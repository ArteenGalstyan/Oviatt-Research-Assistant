		"Abstract": "To adequately support these students in their classrooms, art teachers will need to work collaboratively with special education teachers to ensure student success. Although art teachers might naturally incorporate some of these practices as part of their general classroom routine, there may not be sufficient time to properly prepare and support all students - especially students who struggle with communication skills in reading, speaking, or writing. The special education teacher had emailed the visual arts teacher to let her know of Stephanie's identified areas of interest, and the art education teacher printed out several pages of images related to dogs and music. By working together closely, special education teachers and art teachers can plan for and support students to be successful in the visual arts classroom. [Extracted from the article]"

		"Abstract": "The humanities have been increasingly incorporated into medical school curricula in order to promote clinical skills and professional formation. To understand its current use, we reviewed the literature on visual arts training in medical education, including relevant qualitative and quantitative data. Common themes that emerged from this review included a focus on preclinical students; instruction promoting observation, diagnostic skills, empathy, team building, communication skills, resilience, and cultural sensitivity. Successful partnerships have involved local art museums, with sessions led primarily by art educators employing validated pedagogy such as Visual Thinking Strategies or Artful Thinking. There is evidence that structured visual arts curricula can facilitate the development of clinical observational skills, although these studies are limited in that they have been single-institution reports, short term, involved small numbers of students and often lacked controls. There is a paucity of rigorous published data demonstrating that medial student art education training promotes empathy, team building, communication skills, wellness and resilience, or cultural sensitivity. Given these concerns, recommendations are offered for fostering more robust, evidence-based approaches for using visual arts instruction in the training of medical students. "

		"Abstract": "In this study, I want to find the meaning of art by revealing the common points of art in two books: Heidegger's The origin of the work of art and Heejae You's An outline of art. This is maybe not only two men's view but also the very basic concept of general art. This study is divided by three main parts. First, \"How are language and thought connected?\" and \"How could the meaning of art be considered through this concept.\" Heidegger insists that language is the important medium that determines thought of 'being itself', not just a way of conversation. In An outline of art, Heejae You presents similar concepts. Second is the connection between Heidegger's \"Art is basically a dichtung\" and An outline of art's view. Dichtung is not simply reading the meaning of text or image, but also incorporates speculation about the part without being thought. Third, Heejae You's corresponding point about Heidegger's 'das besinnliche Wissen'. The main study finding is the commonness between Eastern and Western art by comparing Heidegger's art view and Heejae You's art view, who studied the ancient China's overall literature. "

		"Abstract": "Given that promoting social justice is one of the central organizing principles of social work, it comes as no surprise that participatory action research has gained much attention among social work researchers. While much has been written about promising practices of participatory action research with various marginalized communities, there remains a dearth of participatory action research literature that focuses on trans* people, a population often under attack in current socio-political climates. In this paper, we report on a participatory action research project, in which a trans* artist worked closely with trans* youth participants (n = 5) to assist them through a creative project. Using a queer theoretical lens and drawing from the concept of \"queer world-making,\" the participants recast cultural representations about what it means to be trans* in their chosen artistic medium. This paper suggests that art can serve as a transformative research practice with trans* youth. Our findings suggest that the rhetorical binary of trans* vulnerability and resilience does not adequately represent lived experience. We make this argument by demonstrating the following processes through which youths engaged art in this participatory action research project: (1) countering normative discourses of what it means to be trans*, (2) promoting self- reflection and expression, and (3) facilitating \"queer counterpublics.\" In so doing, we make an argument for art as a qualitative research process that holds much promise in uncovering and challenging the normative discourse and developing a much more complex and nuanced understanding of what it means to be trans* youth.

		"Abstract": "Previous studies have shown the beneficial impacts of arts participation and cultural engagement on health outcomes. However, this engagement is socially patterned and is also possibly influenced by geographical factors. The aim of this study was to examine the association between geographical factors (spatial setting and neighbourhood characteristics) and arts and cultural engagement amongst adults in the UK. Data analysed were from Understanding Society Wave 2 (2010/12) with a total sample size of 26,215. Logistic and ordinal regression was used to identify geographical predictors for the patterns of the engagement. Our results show that there are geographical differences in participation independent of individual demographic and socio-economic backgrounds. In particular, there was more evidence for differences in the participation based on neighbourhood characteristics (e.g. level of area deprivation). We also found some interactions between individual and geographical factors for cultural engagement but not for arts participation. This study reveals a geographical and individual socio-economic gradient in arts and cultural engagement. Given the health benefits of arts engagement, improving access to arts and cultural programmes geographically may potentially help to reduce health inequalities. • Our study demonstrates a gradient for arts engagement across area deprivation. • Arts engagement varies based on neighbourhood characteristics. • Spatial setting has less influence on levels of arts engagement. • Interactions are found between individual and geographical factors and engagement.

		"Abstract": "Objectives: The arts are increasingly recognised as important and beneficial activities for people living with dementia. However, there is little peer-reviewed published research exploring arts-based learning for dementia care staff. In response, this paper explores (a) how dementia care staff describe forms of communication in care settings, and (b) the impact on communication following four sessions of 'Creative Conversations', an arts-based intervention for skills development. Method: Fourteen care homes received the intervention, delivered as 4 × 2 hour sessions. The intervention uses a range of activities (e.g. poetry, film, music, art making). Twenty–eight care staff were opportunistically sampled (mean age = 42.29), and provided pre-post qualitative data, obtained through interviews. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: At baseline, the dominant 'task-focussed' nature of care work was described as a barrier to communication, challenging opportunities for developing meaningful relationships with residents. Post-intervention, three primary themes were identified regarding improving communication: (1) learning through the arts (secondary themes: simplicity and subtlety, innovation in communication, and strengthening the role of non-verbal communication), (2) Enhancing creative approaches to care (secondary themes: element of surprise, confidence to experiment and catalyst for communication) and (3) professional introspection (secondary themes: development of empathy, sharing knowledge and experiences and a new appreciation). Conclusions: The intervention validated staff skills and confidence, enabling meaningful interactions that could be creative, 'in the moment', spontaneous and improvised. This arts-based intervention, which departs from formal education and fact-based learning may be particularly useful for the development of the dementia care workforce. "

		"Abstract": "Objective: In the knowledge base examining experiences of childhood brain injury, the perspectives of children with brain injury are notably lacking. This failure to represent the voices of pediatric clients has resulted in an incomplete knowledge base from which to inform evidence-based rehabilitation practice. In this paper, we examine why the perspectives of children with brain injury are rarely sought and propose a new way forward. Methods: We draw upon current evidence and practices in related fields and present an exemplar from an in-progress qualitative arts-based research project with children with brain injury. Results: Assumptions ingrained in research practices, particularly those surrounding the capacity of 'doubly vulnerable' children with brain injury to produce knowledge, have resulted in the relative exclusion of this group from research that concerns them. For the field to evolve, research practices must value children's first-hand accounts, engage them in co-constructing knowledge about their lives, and invite methods that meet their interests and abilities. Conclusion: By reframing how we think about the capacities of children with disabilities and shifting our research practices to include children with brain injury as knowledgeable participants, it becomes possible to expand the knowledge base upon which clinical rehabilitation practices are built. Current research practices preclude 'doubly vulnerable' pediatric populations, including children with brain injury, from actively contributing to research that concerns them. As a result, the perspectives of children with brain injury are virtually absent from research, rendering the evidence base upon which rehabilitative practices are built incomplete. Reframing how we think about the capacities of children with brain injury can shift how we engage with them, both in research and clinic, and may subsequently impact the knowledge available to us. Implications for client-centred rehabilitation are discussed, including the need to understand children as capable of insight into their own experience, as able to contribute to a more complete understanding of the health phenomena that affect them, and as invaluable and active participants in research and clinical care.

		"Abstract": "During his studies at Moscow University and thereafter, Lev S. Vygotsky's (1896–1934) interests focused mostly on the scholarly study of literary and theatre criticism. Shakespeare's Hamlet served as a leitmotiv to understand the specificity of the arts within western culture: through analysis of the structural particularities of Hamlet, he provided a model for an understanding of how the mind functions during interactions with artworks and reconstructed the internal activity caused by art. His thoughts on the visual arts are few, but fragments are found in his seminal work entitled Psychology of Art (1926). Here, he showed the function of catharsis, the main concept of his theory of aesthetic experience. This paper presents a translation of Vygotsky's essay published in 1926, dedicated to the art of Alexandr Bykhovsky (1888–1978), a companion since his Gomel period (1919–1924). The significance of this essay is twofold. First, it represents a concise and lasting testimony to the creativity of an important Russian artist; second, the essay goes beyond formal analysis of the artwork. Instead, Vygotsky's analysis explains the phenomenon of aesthetic experience as the viewer and the artwork interact and transform each other. The paper is preceded by a note on the contextual and biographical settings in which both Vygotsky and Bykhovsky worked. "

		"Abstract": "Although ecological grief is a common psychic response to socioecological losses, there are no shared spaces to engage with it in Western cultures—a symptom of the problematic way they conceive Nature as external and subordinate to humans. Seeking subversive impulses for paradigmatic transformation, this research centers queer-identifying eco-activists and -artists, and their practices of queer-ecological worldmaking. Arts-based research and interviews reveal the potential of melancholic grieving to create an understanding of interdependencies with the more-than-human world, as well as communities for healing. Impulses toward a joint liberation entail the extension of empathy and agency to the more-than-human world. "

		"Abstract": "Objectives This study investigated whether frequency of receptive arts engagement over 10 years contributes to experienced, evaluative, and eudaimonic well-being in older adults. Methods We used repeated data of 3,188 respondents from Waves 2–7 (2004/2005–2014/2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. We examined longitudinal associations between short-term (frequent engagement at one wave), repeated (frequent engagement at 2–3 waves), and sustained (frequent engagement at 4–6 waves) arts engagement and experienced, evaluative and eudaimonic well-being. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for baseline well-being and a number of sociodemographic, economic, health, and social engagement factors. Results In the fully adjusted models, short-term engagement was not longitudinally associated with well-being, but repeated engagement with the theater/concerts/opera and museums/galleries/exhibitions was associated with enhanced eudaimonic well-being, and sustained engagement with these activities was associated with greater experienced, evaluative, and eudaimonic well-being. Discussion Long-term frequent engagement with certain arts activities is associated with higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction, self-realization, and control/autonomy in older adults. These findings suggest that policies that facilitate older adults' access to arts venues and activities, and support their continued engagement with them, may help to promote happy, fulfilling lives of an increasing segment of the population.

		"Abstract": "This paper addresses the question of the nature of art, how it came to be, how it fits with other communications revolutions, and the implications of the emergence of art as a means of visual communication. How did iconic imagery emerge from other mark-making among humans and their ancestors and what has been its significance? I situate visual communication as the second revolution of the six communication revolutions during human evolution: the emergence of language, iconic imagery, writing, printing, various means of communication at a distance, and the digital electronic revolution. I begin by discussing the context of deliberate production of marks in the environment, with emphasis on the relations between (1) the producer of the mark and the mark, (2) the producer of the mark and an informed observer at the time, (3) the mark and the informed observer in the absence of the producer and (4) the uninformed observer and the mark. It is fundamental that at some stage the producer intended the mark to represent something, a subject in the real or imagined world. I emphasize the importance of telling stories and singing songs in secular and ritual contexts. Out of this framework, I discuss some of the earliest objects called art in relation to their semiotic elements. I outline my arguments about how these semiotic categories were transformed in the emergence of pictures during archaeohistory. I go on to discuss how all these examples of image production connect to that which is called art in western society. I conclude by reflecting on the impact of these changes of means of communication on human cognition. Each of the revolutions involved changes in the relationships among the communicative act (sensu lato), the agent and receivers of the communication, the perception and interpretation of the communication and the persistence of it through time and ultimately across space.

		"Abstract": "The term magic has long been associated with both technology and art. Whether an illusion performed on stage or the search for the supernatural, magic is concerned with changing either reality itself or our perception of it. Each new technology takes on a magical role by increasing humans' power to manipulate the world around them. Similarly, magical practices are often labeled arts, and the manipulation of our perceptions by artists often creates quasi-magical experiences. Four approaches to magic in relation to digital art practice--illusionist, alchemist, necromancer and sorcerer--offer a mode of understanding the manipulation of perceptual reality by artists using digital technologies. The framework will then be applied to five such practitioners--Pascal Dombis, Anne-Sarah Le Meur, Antoine Schmitt, Dmitry Morozov and Zaven Paré--who demonstrate the quest for the unknown and the manipulation of knowledge to create a new reality.

		"Abstract": "This article will explore anamorphosis in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001). Appearing almost simultaneously with perspective as a mode of organizing sight in visual art and architecture mainly, anamorphosis was a type of perspective, popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which an image that was severely distorted could become suddenly \"legible\" if looked at from the correct angle. Among the ways that anamorphosis is evident in Mulholland Drive is its two-part design, which forces viewers to detect a hidden perspective in the first part of the film. Anamorphosis is visible also in the distortive imagery and changes in optical registers, such as the stylized jitterbug scene at the start of the film. Anamorphosis, finally, is noticeable in the form of an anamorphic figure like the Cowboy who casts a haunting pall over the action and who seems to exist both in the world of the film and outside, entering mysteriously or obliquely, at an angle as it were, with no clear, determinable place of origin. An analysis of anamorphosis in Mulholland Drive leads me to argue that an anamorphic drive is central to Lynch's work more generally and that Lynch belongs to a very long tradition in the visual arts dating back to the fifteenth century.

The use-of-history is also an aim in the curricula of Nordic countries. This capacity is, however, rarely operationalized in current research on historical competence. This article coins the concept of 'performative historical competence', meaning use-of-history as symbolic action. We argue that Kenneth Burke's dramatist theory allows students to examine how history is used in different ways for different purposes in different content and contexts, thus allowing a more conscious, critical and creative approach to the use-of-history as symbolic action. This by emphasizing history based contradictions, competition and conflict as constructs rather than given by nature. In turn, they can be redefined. This can be an empowering process. "

It begins by pointing out the surprising paucity of writing on the history of equality, particularly its conceptual and intellectual history, despite that notion's centrality in modern political and philosophical discussion. It proceeds to examine recent efforts to make amends for that lack. What Pierre Rosanvallon has described as the contemporary \"crisis of equality\" gives urgency to these efforts, while also, it is suggested, providing an opportunity to more fully explore the contingencies and complexities of this beguiling notion. Stuurman's examination of the invention and deployment of \"cross‐cultural equality\"—the basic equality of all people living in the world, regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, or race—is an important step in this exploration. But as Samuel Moyn has emphasized in his own recent intervention on the history of social rights in an unequal world, it is not, on its own, enough. Future efforts to write the history of equality must integrate the social and economic dimensions of the idea more fully in an effort to better understand our contemporary dilemma. "

Yet the more familiar notion of 'history's lessons'—a notion which tends to make most historians uncomfortable, and which surely demands thoroughgoing skepticism—is far from exhaustive of history's uses in the practice and study of international relations. One important and timely subject is the more constitutive role of history in international deliberations over the creation, fragmentation and transformation of nation-states. What follows is a historical comparison of the changing ways in which the past has been used to frame the terms and content of such debates. While we will be exploring the uses of history as a guide or teacher, we propose to examine more specifically and at greater length the growth and persistence of newer uses: first, to bolster claims to independence and territory; and second, in demanding restitution in the form of financial reparations, apologies and other social privileges. By examining the ways in which history was used 100 years ago at the end of the First World War and in recent episodes of the Cold War and post-Cold War eras, we hope to show continuities and differences. What specialists must appreciate is that history is being used and will continue to be used not only within the confines of the academy, but within international society itself, where it may serve as a foundation for arbitrating political disagreements. If anything, non-specialist and popular reliance on history has grown, possibly because other forms of authority have attenuated. "

		"Abstract": "This article focuses on the relations between the Internet, religion and 'Kongo history'. The websites under study claim an existing 'Kongo community' and recurrently evoke the Kongo kingdom and historical figures like Kimpa Vita and Simon Kimbangu. Texts and images on Kongo history have long been available in print media, but through the increasing accessibility to the Internet and the consequent possibilities of online activities the distribution of these texts and images have obtained a new dynamic. The article focuses on the references to Kongo history as persuasive strategy and procedure to include or exclude groups of people as intended audience. It will be shown that on religious websites with a 'Kongo connection', history functions in a framework of truth versus lies, through which studying and subsequently revealing the true history of the 'chosen' people can lead to redemption. 'History' on these sites is not only important for its particular contents, it also functions in formal and stylistic ways to convince a particular audience. Through this analysis, it will be possible to connect the fashionable scholarly notion of 'style' to the ways in which the past is made to function in the present. "

		"Abstract": "Among the ongoing revolutions in historical research is the flood of new information about the past that comes not from written documents but from the natural sciences and archaeology. What might this mean for the profession of history, and for our training and institutional practices? How might it affect our research and interpretations of the past? Which fields of history will be most and least affected? I argue for a cautious embrace of the new data about the past coming from the paleosciences, offering a few examples of the promise and perils presented by the work of our natural science and archaeology colleagues. With each passing year, the proportion of our knowledge of the past that derives from the kinds of documents we have learned to read and interpret will shrink, and the proportion that derives from what to most of us are unfamiliar sciences will mount. This has implications. First, the deeper past might make a comeback. The last century or two are the best documented and will likely be least affected by the flood. The intellectual excitement may tip toward the study of earlier centuries where relative significance of information in other formats is greater. Second, the ways in which we train historians may need to change. A possible partial guide to our future as historians is the experience of precolonial Africanists, who are accustomed to research without written documents. "

The first part of this research work seeks to understand its meaning through a twofold elaboration: (1) the historical setting of the three philosophical trends in which this concept was developed: scholastic (conservation), Cartesian (conservation through repetition of the creative act at each instant), and dynamic (interpreting the emergence of radical and contingent novelty in nature as a sign of the continuity of creation); (2) a philosophical and theological critique of the concept of continuous creation regarding the question of the relationship between change and creation, in the light of its highly polymorphous contemporary use, and, in opposition, its absence within the Catholic Magisterium. This work opens the field a further step toward reflection on a renewed concept of continuous creation. "

Approach: Drawing upon history frameworks and approaches to history research, greater engagement of clinical nurses in recording nursing history is canvassed. A basic framework for developing historical research from practice narratives is suggested as a feasible option. Outcomes: Topics identified: a) nurses' awareness of their history and nursing's professional standing; b) the importance of oral history in nursing development; and c) digital influences on history research and constructing historical narratives. Conclusion: Clinical nurses' stories contribute to historical research. All nurses are responsible for gathering and distributing contemporary local narratives on clinical nursing. Oral history research provides a framework for nurses to record and share stories. Implications: Recorded history can prevent nursing from being trivialized or misrepresented. Missing accounts of contemporary nursing create gaps in our narrative and risk future professional disempowerment. "

Scholars have been quick to attribute the growing interest in historical social networks to movements for interdisciplinary research, new possibilities presented by digital technologies, and the prominence of the term \"social network\" in present-day culture. In contrast, this article reconnects recent trends to longstanding attention to the nature of early modern social relations, which has its roots in the foundations of modern social thought laid in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and developed through the postwar decades in both history and sociology. In doing so, the article shows the extent to which social network analysis shares antecedents, interests, and goals with more traditional historical methods. It argues that, when sensitively applied, network approaches present many opportunities for historians engaging with enduring questions about the nature of social relations in the past. "

To estimate the combined effect of California's Tobacco 21 law (enacted June 2016) and $2-per-pack cigarette excise tax increase (enacted April 2017) on cigarette prices and sales, compared with matched comparator states. Methods. We used synthetic control methods to compare cigarette prices and sales after the policies were enacted, relative to what we would have expected without the policy reforms. To estimate the counterfactual, we matched pre-reform covariate and outcome trends between California and control states to construct a \"synthetic\" California. Results. Compared with the synthetic control in 2018, cigarette prices in California were $1.89 higher ($7.86 vs $5.97; P <.001), and cigarette sales were 16.6% lower (19.9 vs 16.6 packs per capita; P <.001). This reduction in sales equates to 153.9 million fewer packs being sold between 2017 and 2018. Conclusions. California's new cigarette tax was largely passed on to consumers. The new cigarette tax, combined with the Tobacco 21 law, have contributed to a rapid and substantial reduction in cigarette consumption in California. "

		"Abstract": "Blockchain has rapidly become one of the most popular technologies that companies are scrambling to integrate into their businesses. The accelerated development of blockchain has created a race to obtain patents incorporating the technology. Fortune 500 companies including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Mastercard are at the forefront of the sprint to patent blockchain. However, blockchain is not limited to high profde companies. Recent studies have shown as many as 80% of executives are using or considering the use of blockchain technology to improve their business models. Despite the increase in patent applications involving blockchain, it is unlikely that these applications are even capable of being patented. Over the past fifty years the courts have been tasked with the role of crafting a subject matter eligibility test, specifically for patent claims directed at abstract ideas. Most recently, the Supreme Court has laid out the test in Alice Corp. Proprietary Ltd. v. CLS Bank International. The first step in the test focuses on whether the claim is directed at a patent ineligible concept. If it is, then the test proceeds to the second step which analyzes whether there is a sufficiently inventive concept in the claim that makes the patent ineligible concept innovative and eligible to be patented. Alice Corp. held that an application directed at a patent ineligible concept is not sufficiently inventive simply because of its use of software or a computer to enhance the application. The use of software is not sufficiently inventive because software focuses on providing a method of implementing an abstract idea rather than improving the process. This Comment analyses the subject matter eligibility test for patent claims, specifically software-based claims, outlined in Alice Corp., and compares software to blockchain. Focusing on the striking similarities between software and blockchain, this Comment analyzes why blockchain claims, like software claims, are generally patent ineligible technology. Finally, this Comment argues that blockchain claims are not only patent ineligible subject matter but allowing the technology to be patented will lead to less innovation. Patenting blockchain could lead to many unintended consequences such as stifling the growth of the technology. "

Even in cases where there are no serious outcomes and patients return, treatment can be interrupted and staff morale compromised. Given these potential deleterious effects, it is important to have an in-depth understanding of why people leave when they do. The aim of this study is to examine the profile of service-users who leave in-patient psychiatric care without notifying staff and to determine their reasons for doing so, what they did when they left the hospital setting and reasons for returning. This is a prospective descriptive study of service users leaving without notifying staff from a national mental health service in Ireland. It investigated the frequency, timing, and motivations of these absconding events among a sample of in-patients over a 12-month period. This year-long review identified 75 episodes of leaving without notifying staff, 55 of which met this studies criteria. 22% of episodes were from a locked unit, 58.2% were repeated episodes. 89% of service users returned to hospital following the episode and 11% were discharged against medical advice. Although no fatalities, three service users were seen in an emergency department as a result of activity during leave. Upon return from leave, all service users were reviewed and their care plans were updated where necessary. "

		"Abstract": "Background: Flooding is an increasingly prevalent natural hazard worldwide and can have a profound impact on the mental health of those directly and indirectly affected. Little is known about the impact on business owners, who may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health complications of flooding given the additional economic stressors. Methods: A large cross-sectional survey was conducted six months after severe flooding in the rural Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia in 2017. The survey assessed demographics, probable depression (using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2), flood exposure, flood-related financial factors, prior flood exposure and support from various organisations. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of probable depression in 653 of the 745 participants who identified as business owners. Results: The prevalence of probable depression in our sample was 17.0%. A quarter (25.1%) of business owners whose business was flooded suffered from probable depression, compared to 12.4% of non-flooded business owners. The multivariable model for probable depression demonstrated elevated adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for business owners who had to evacuate their business (AOR = 2.11, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.25–3.57) compared to those who did not evacuate. Insurance disputes/rejections were a strong predictor for probable depression (AOR = 3.76, CI 1.86–7.60). Those whose income was reduced due to the flood and had not returned to normal six months post-flood demonstrated an increased AOR for probable depression (AOR 2.53, CI 1.26–5.07) compared to those whose income had returned to normal. The univariable analysis found elevated crude odds ratios (OR) for the cumulative effect of multiple flood exposures and unmet support needs by the state government (OR = 2.74, CI 1.12–6.68). The majority of business owners felt their needs were not met by most organisations providing flood-related support. Conclusion: The impact of flood exposure and flood-related financial factors on probable depression was highly significant for the business owner population. Furthermore, business owners felt under-supported by flood-related services. These findings highlight the vulnerability of exposed business owners and the need for increased support. Disaster planning programs in conjunction with system level changes such as infrastructure and education are vital for disaster preparedness. "

		"Abstract": "Policy changes to school governance have led to Governing Bodies (GBs) increasingly appointing skilled professionals from the business community. Research into these GBs views governors from business as a threat to lay governors and the stakeholder model. Whilst there has been exploration of the contributions of business governors, the ways in which business volunteers develop into their new roles as business governors have not been captured. This article is drawn from an evaluation of Lloyds Banking Group's (LBG) school governance programme where 18 LBG employees were interviewed throughout the first year in their governor roles. Adapting Young's categorisation of knowledge as 'managerial', 'educational' and 'lay', this article articulates how LBG governors acquired 'educational' and 'lay' knowledge to transform their practices and how this was underpinned by 'authenticity' associated with the stakeholder model. The article presents perspectives from other GB stakeholders which suggest that the transformation of the LBG governors' practice has impacted upon GBs, with them crossing boundaries between landscapes of practice. The implications are that, within the context of performativity, the wider business sector has a role to play in school governance. Understanding governor professional development is key to this. "

		"Abstract": "Purpose: This study seeks to illuminate business instructors' undergraduate pedagogical processes toward developing resources and services to support their teaching. Design/methodology/approach: The authors recruited participants through purposeful sampling and collected data through semi-structured interviews. The transcriptions were coded using a grounded theory approach. Findings: The findings of this study demonstrate that faculty are motivated to be good teachers and want to engage in opportunities to improve. However, lack of time and teaching with technology pose pedagogical learning curves for faculty. Institutional support for improving teaching is welcomed, but it may also be perceived as white noise against competing priorities and a deluge of information. Lastly, business, as a discipline, may uniquely use informational formats such as multimedia and case studies that may pose a challenge to traditional collection development. Research limitations/implications: The project was designed to be exploratory, small-scale and grounded in approach. This study does not purport to be statistically representative nor are the recommendations meant to be prescriptive. Practical implications: Academic libraries should be more intentional about positioning subject librarians to provide suggestions for textbooks or other course materials, collecting, organizing and preserving case studies and multimedia and their relationships with publishers that use models that subvert collecting textbooks. Libraries should also partner with technology and pedagogy support units to offer cooperative programming when possible. Originality/value: This study contributes to the fields of library and information studies, business and education by articulating the unique needs of instructors within the larger contexts of business pedagogy, and the evolving relationship between libraries and undergraduate teaching support.

		"Abstract": "This paper investigates and explores the link between the resilience of organisations, its human capital and firm performance. We base our analysis on the resource‐based view of the firm, cluster strategy, and conservation of resources theories. Our contribution is contextualised by comparing the performance of business clusters across two observational periods, namely pre‐recession (2005–2007) and recession (2008–2009) period. We identify six relevant indicators from the extant literature that capture economic dynamism, human capital, and financial viability of firms in order to capture the performance across clusters and capture resilience to the global financial crisis. We contribute by identifying organisations in business clusters that perform better due to being more resilient, particularly during challenging times. Through triangulation we find overwhelming evidence of the overarching role and importance of human capital (people) in driving more successful organisations in business clusters as they possess greater resilience during challenging times such as the recent global financial crises. We show that strong clusters not only improve regional employment and turnover growth over time, but improve resilience of regional economies to downturns through resource gain and crossover processes. We further illustrate that understanding the impact of resource reservoirs, resource passageways and crossover provides a framework for further research and intervention to promote resilience in organisations.

		"Abstract": "During the last three decades in both the United States and Europe, neoliberal policies, especially privatization, have restructured services in ways that dramatically affect the capacity of human services workers and agencies to serve all clients. Privatization means not only transforming public programs such as Social Security, but also managerialism —the incorporation of business principles, methods, and goals into public and nonprofit human services organizations. Few researchers have looked at the impact of market-based managerialism (focused on productivity, accountability, efficiency, and standardization) on social work's mission and the effectiveness of human services workers and organizations. Using an anonymous survey of 3,000 New York City human services workers, authors examined the impact of managerialist practices including performance measures, quantifiable short-term outcomes, and routinized practices on frontline workers and service provision. A troubling trend emerged. Workers in agencies with a high commitment to managerialism found it considerably more difficult to adhere to social work's mission and fundamental values. This conflict between the \"logic of the market\" and the \"logic of social work\" subsided dramatically in agencies with a low commitment to managerialism, indicating that even in today's competitive environment, agencies can protect the social work mission.

		"Abstract": "There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a 'health in all policy' approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a 'whole council' approach. • This piece presents the case for why gambling is a particularly unique public health issue which requires a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach. • It explores opportunities for action at national and local level, using examples of work underway. • It concludes with a call to action using lesson learnt from managing harms from similar public health threats.

		"Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that a majority of vendors at farmers markets reuse cardboard cartons to store and transport produce to and from farmers markets, rendering the cartons a potential source of microbial contamination. This study investigated the ability of foodborne pathogens to persist on cardboard cartons over 44 days. Briefly, a mixture of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and E. coli O157:H7 were inoculated onto cardboard coupons and pathogen viability was quantified for up to 44 days. The results demonstrated that while E. coli O157:H7 survived for no longer than 2 days, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were recovered up to 32 and 44 days, respectively. These results highlight key challenges associated with reusing cardboard containers and the potential of microbial contamination transfer onto produce. The results of this study emphasize the need for science-based food safety training for vendors and managers at farmers markets to ensure that only containers that can be easily cleaned and sanitized are used to transport and store produce.

		"Abstract": "Since their advent in the 1970s, Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) have played a central role in downtown renewal in cities around the world. With wide-ranging mandates to market, promote, beautify and advocate on behalf of their membership, the activities of each BIA reflect the diverse needs of their respective downtowns. While the number of BIAs continues to grow, little attention has been paid to their role in urban affairs in the context of mid-sized cities, and this paper seeks to address that gap in the literature. Using a local economic development (LED) framework that highlights the role of community allies in urban affairs, this paper explores the role BIAs can play partners to downtown revitalization within the context of a series of mid-sized cities in a designated growth area in Ontario, Canada. Findings from this research show that incremental improvements are occurring in the downtowns of these mid-sized cities, and that BIAs, through a combination of operational activities and broad-based coalition building, are contributing to downtown revitalization by pursuing a downtown-first agenda. However, as the scholarship continues to evolve around downtowns, this research explores the limitations of merchant-led associations and offers recommendations that re-envision the BIA model to meet the challenges of revitalization in the downtowns of mid-sized cities.

It emphasizes the importance of cost considerations in shaping business preferences and argues that their willingness to support and ability to oppose demands for increases in the generosity of social insurance programmes depends primarily on the extent to which labour unions accept that these increases are to be financed by workers themselves. Based on a comparative-historical analysis of postwar welfare state development in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the article shows that this willingness among others depended on the type of labour market risk, the margin for pay increases, and the extent to which social welfare initiatives were perceived as actual improvements to the social wage by labour unions.

The 2019 Medical Communication Compensation Survey obtained data from 480 freelances, including 179 who work full-time, and provides an excellent source of information on the rates being charged by independent contractors in this field and factors that may be associated with differences in those rates, as well as common expenses, business structures, and practices. Full-time freelances reported median hourly rates of $110 for writing, $85 for editing, and $100 for quality control. Rates were highest for freelances who had more experience in medical communications, those with advanced degrees, and those who were primarily writers. The majority of full-time freelances charged by the hour, rather than by the project, and 50% reported increased profitability of their business in 2018, whereas 12% reported decreased profitability. The 2019 Medical Communication Compensation Survey reflects real-world data reported by working medical communicators. The results offer a unique insight into the business of freelancing and are a valuable resource for both working freelances as well as those interested in striking out on their own. "

		"Abstract": "Background: Traditional bamboo weaving has been practiced for centuries in Sansui, a county dominated by the Miao people, in Guizhou province of Southwest China. Sansui bamboo weaving represents an intangible cultural heritage as defined by UNESCO, but, like many other traditional handicrafts in China, it has suffered a downfall in this period of rapid development. Sansui bamboo weaving is now experiencing a renaissance due to the joint efforts of the local government, bamboo weaving companies, and individual bamboo weavers. However, what bamboo species have supported the traditional bamboo weaving in Sansui keeps unknown up to now. The traditional knowledge and technology associated with bamboo weaving have not been reported. In addition, the resumption of the local bamboo industry may provide some valuable experiences for other downfallen traditional handicrafts or local communities. Thus, an ethnobotanical study on Sansui bamboo weaving has been carried out. Methods: This study mainly used ethnobotanical methods, including key informant interviews and participatory observations. Different stakeholders were selected by applying the snowball method as our key informants including 6 officials, 37 bamboo weavers, and 17 bamboo and bamboo weaving product merchants. We also went into the local weavers' houses to visit the whole weaving process. The bamboo and dye plant species for bamboo weaving were identified by taxonomists and referring to online databases available. Results: Based on field investigations, 17 bamboo species used for weaving were recorded. Different bamboo species were woven for different purposes based on their own characters. Phyllostachys heteroclada is the most popular species locally. Bamboo strips are usually dyed by using Platycarya strobilacea and Rubia cordifolia to be made for different images. In recent years, the size, functions, and materials of local bamboo weaving crafts as well as their market mode have been changed to adapt to new development trends and to cater to the market. In addition, the cooperation among bamboo weavers, bamboo companies, and household workshops has provided great support to the local bamboo industry and to reboot the economy of the local community. Some suggestions for the sustainable economic development of Sansui bamboo weaving and other Chinese traditional handicrafts are proposed. Conclusion: In the present study, the bamboo weaving-associated traditional knowledge was collected by means of ethnobotanical methods. The recent renaissance of the bamboo weaving business in Sansui can be attributed both to government support and the innovations of the bamboo weaving industry itself. The developing mode (\"Internet + intangible cultural heritage + poverty alleviation\"), which combined the internet, poverty alleviation, and intangible cultural heritage, is valid and worth being promoted.

		"Abstract": "During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from all water, food, and medications from dawn till dusk. To date, the existing medical literature focuses on adult fasting with little attention paid to pediatric fasting practices. An anonymous, digital, bilingual survey was conducted using Qualtrics software. Participants were recruited in-person at various community clinics, businesses, and mosques as well as online via social media. To be eligible for the study, participants must identify as Muslim and be parents or guardians of child/ren between the age/s of 7 and 18. Between July 2017 and May 2018, 918 people took part in the initial survey, with 70% (524/751) of participants living in Wayne County, MI. Approximately 80% (624/779) identified as Arab American and 57% (437/773) as immigrants to the US. Over 63% (522/827) of participants reported that their child's health care provider was unaware that their child/ren fasted during Ramadan. In addition, 75% (613/820) of participants indicated that their child's health care provider did not offer them any medical advice regarding fasting. However, 69% (554/805) of participants reported being comfortable discussing fasting practices with their child's doctor. Furthermore, 80% (569/714), of participants reported that their child/ren's doctor had a good or an advanced understanding of fasting. Our study is an important first step in helping elucidate beliefs and practices about Muslim pediatric fasting in Michigan. In addition, it highlights a stark contrast between the perceptions of parents and the current clinical practice of their physicians. "

		"Abstract": "We seek to delineate the processes by which work relationships between employees from buyer and supplier organisations can enhance the supplier's resilience. A micro‐foundations perspective is taken to study the effect of individual‐level relationships on these higher‐level processes in the context of a declining organisation—a supplier that has been experiencing a period of size decline, following the transition of some of its stronger competitors to a more advanced generation of products. The findings of a qualitative study indicate that the work relationships built between employees from the supplier and the customers around current product and services offerings can help a declining organisation to cope with setbacks and difficulties. Expanding on the three C's of hardiness (challenge, control, and commitment), we discuss the implications of our research for the study of resilience through the lens of interorganisational work relationships and highlight the different pathways that build these coping and adaptation qualities for the organisation. Specifically, the challenge of transitioning to new products can negatively influence these work relationships unless the supplier organisation provides supportive context by allowing employees to retain the necessary control over what it takes to serve their customers. Furthermore, the supplier should display strong commitment to integrate the new offerings while customers need to mirror this commitment by developing a willingness to adopt these new offerings by the supplier. The findings further suggest that these new offerings can be translated into higher levels of adaptation. "

		"Abstract": "By any metric, the twentieth century university was a successful institution. However, in the twenty-first century, ongoing neoliberal educational reform has been accompanied by a growing epistemological crisis in the meaning and value of the humanities and social sciences (HaSS). Concerns have been expressed in two main forms. The governors of tertiary education systems—governments, private investors, university managers and consultancy firms—have focused on how HaSS can adapt to the perceived research needs of the 21st century. At the same time, a competing set of discourses has been generated by scholars and researchers employed within the critical HaSS themselves. This article considers what these differing perspectives mean for reconceptualising HaSS for the twenty-first century. After surveying the contemporary climate, this article examines the findings of key reports on the future of the humanities from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Alongside those of Western Europe, these university systems are arguably the key drivers for the global university system. It is argued that these reports provide an opportunity for emerging universities to reflect on their research priorities and developmental strategies. The article concludes with some reflections on the wider consequences of the globalising of the university system, the increase of China's influence in Asia, and ponders the prospect of post-human/ist futures of the humanities.

Research shows that such topics are necessary for the development of critical thinking, this type of analysis being innate to these domains. In this paper, I introduce the concept of creating meaning, which I define as the link between creative thinking and critical thinking and as the first attribute of a critical thinker. Before making inferences, judgements or decisions, one must identify the framework of a problem, determine the parameters of the discussion and reflect upon assumptions. These are propaedeutic to a good discussion and are prerequisites of a good critical thinker. Arguing that creativity is not a separate process from critical thinking, I aim to demonstrate that the Arts, Humanities and Cultural Studies are the promoters of critical thinking. Because disciplines in these fields are likely to create environments that foster critical thinking and encourage the production of meaning, I argue that these necessarily belong in all curricula of Higher Education.

		"Abstract": "For some time now, the field of Spatial Humanities has acknowledged the need for a system capable of the spatial exploration of historical and archaeological phenomena beyond Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This idea comes from the need to analyse holistically spatial information, including that which is not geographic (i.e. vague, symbolic and imaginary space). In addition, this need becomes more apparent when dealing with traditions that do not conform to the Modern/European/Cartesian conception of space in which GIS is rooted. This article, explores the use of Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) and Semantic Triples as possible alternative means to model complex and diverse expressions of spatial information, including social and symbolic conceptions in 16th century Mexican maps. Using as case study the map from the region of Atengo-Misquiahuala (Hidalgo) which combine the Mesoamerican and European traditions, we explore how these approaches might open new venues of research, potentially shedding light to long discussed and problematic Mesoamerican spatial categories. Focusing on a contained and partial example, we examine from a theoretical perspective and as a starting point, the possible future implementation of these approaches for historical and archaeological research.

		"Abstract": "'Qualitative spatial reasoning and representation' is a range of techniques developed in Artificial Intelligence to meet the need for a computational treatment of qualitative spatial relations. Examples of such relations include 'next to', 'overlapping', 'to the left of', 'separate from', 'including', and so on. These relations occur within the data found in the spatial humanities, but the computational techniques described here do not appear to have been used in connection with this context. While Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are widely used as a means of visualizing and exploring material in the spatial humanities, GIS technology is acknowledged to be ill-suited to information that is vague, uncertain, ambiguous, imprecise or having other qualities that in a scientific setting could be regarded as imperfections. In the humanities such 'imperfections' are of course important, and qualitative spatial relations are one source of data that challenges scientifically based GIS. This article reviews the origin of qualitative spatial reasoning and representation in A. N. Whitehead's mereotopology and argues for exploring how these methods could complement GIS as a computational technique in the humanities. Qualitative representation is applicable to modelling spatial arrangements in many domains, not just geographical space. This is demonstrated through an example of spatial relations in lines of printed text. "

The enquiry combines the Critical Incidents Technique (CIT) and internet-based discourse analysis, drawing on mass media texts and social media discussions. Our analysis identified three major dilemmas that may be created for Chinese HSS academics by their country's aspirations for world-class universities embedded in its complicated socio-political context. First, a highly centralised system restrains academics' autonomy to decide what to research and where to publish. Second, they are conflicted by the need to simultaneously attend to nationalistic interests and publish internationally. Third, ideological correctness is highly important. These findings invite us to reflect on the profound impact of university ranking exercises as a mode of university governance on HSS academics in many contexts. "

		"Abstract": "The transition of Harold Innis' work from staples research to communications studies commonly is understood to have been an extension of his earlier research rather than a dramatic break from it. While in agreement, we argue that a significant transformation in Innis's ontology (but not his epistemology) also took place. This can be understood by referencing his concerns about the fate of civilization and his views on the prospectively strategic role of what he called the Greek tradition. To explain this, herein we concentrate on Innis' largely forgotten book Political Economy in the Modern State, initiated in 1943 and published in 1946, as a window into his intellectual processes. By the latter year, Innis had come to believe that a second Greek-inspired renaissance was needed. Vestiges of the Greek tradition, Innis thought, had to be recalled through the university and the humanities in order to provide society with the reflective universal perspective needed for survival. This transitional and transformational period involving his embrace of the Greek tradition as a kind of ideal type constitutes an important but under assessed aspect of Innis's intellectual development.

		"Abstract": "The current expansion of English language publishing by scholars from China is supported by national and university policies, including monetary and career incentives to publish in English. These incentives, which extend to work in the humanities and social sciences (HSS, the focus of this paper) as well as the sciences and technologies, are situated in evolving strategies of internationalization. China has moved from an internationalization strategy simply based on learning from the West, to a 'going out' strategy designed to both lift domestic research capacity and advance China's influence in the world. However, the 'going out' strategy nonetheless embodies ambiguities and dilemmas. The world of academic knowledge is not a level playing field but more closely approximates the centre–periphery dynamic described in world systems theory. This study explores the influence of publication incentives in the context of a centre–periphery world. It draws on analysis of 172 institutional incentive documents and interviews with 75 HSS academics, university senior administrators, and journal editors. The study identifies practices within China's HSS that reproduce centre–periphery relationships. By focusing on international publications, Chinese universities run the risk of downplaying Chinese-language publications and adopting standards and norms from global centres to assess domestic knowledge production. These could result in creating knowledge from and about China primarily in Western terms without adding a distinctive Chinese strand to the global conversation. Nonetheless, the study also identifies alternative dynamics that challenge the existing power hierarchies in global HSS, highlighting indigenous knowledge and the need to pluralize global knowledge production.

		"Abstract": "This article draws on the efforts to enhance and incentivize the humanities in the Nordic countries in the last quarter century, with a main focus on Sweden. During this period, bibliometric methodologies and a series of 'crisis debates' have formed an image of Nordic humanities as provincial, parochial, and not performing on a par with relatively high levels of achievement in most other science and knowledge fields in the Nordic countries. However, over a period of many years, a parallel collective learning experience has occurred through which the basic evaluation dimensions and criteria have been debated and also deepened. There is now an ongoing move away from the ambition of finding easy-to-operate knowledge management tools, such as performance indicators strictly related to funding systems. In this article it is argued that these tendencies can be linked to the emergence of a new transformations regime of research policy that has gradually taken shape over the past decade and is framing a new generation of humanities knowledge, here called the humanities of transformation, the contours of which are now visible, not least in the Nordic countries. Ultimately, it is possible to identify a far richer and more complex image of quality in the humanities and their performance in the Nordic countries than the one we had when the period of major, structural reform of higher education institutions in the Nordic countries started around 1990.

Our research finds that researchers perceive that evaluation mechanisms relying on bibliometric indicators pressure them to publish more and to publish in international indexed journals. Researchers feel the time available to develop their research before publishing their results has been reduced, which does not allow them to address research questions with the former rigour and to fully exploit information sources. The pressure is also perceived as an obstacle to conceiving long-term intellectual projects. The strong evaluation culture and its accompanying mechanisms are thus perceived as directly undermining the fundamental pillars on which the academic prestige of these departments was built, namely originality, scientific rigour and methodological innovations.

However, fine-grained analysis of patterns of R&D expenditure in SSH research fields over the period 2005/2006-2014/2015 reveals a number of critical issues for both institutional planning and national policymaking. We demonstrate that most SSH R&D expenditure in the 10-year reference period was targeted predominantly within just a few research fields: finance, economics, education, accounting and political science and public policy. By contrast, investment in SSH research fields such as architecture and habitat, media and communication studies, psychology, and transportation studies was strikingly low in the same period, with some research fields, such as dance or tourism, appearing to be at risk of decline. Using these R&D data as a proxy, we argue, principally, that institutional R&D planners and national policymakers need to find a greater balance between current priorities and future needs, if SSH R&D is to be 'leveraged' for larger socio-economic impacts, as is being envisaged in a new draft White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation. Significance: • R&D expenditure in the social sciences and humanities between 2005 and 2014 was concentrated in just a few research fields, such as finance, economics and education. By contrast, R&D expenditure was comparatively low in research fields such as media and communication studies, technology management, architecture and habitat, and dance. • In an era of rapid global technological change, but also deepening local societal challenges, South Africa's national and institutional policymakers face strategic R&D choices.

After reviewing Peters' disentanglement of the ambiguities of liberal education, I reconstruct his view on the status and the existential foundations of the humanities. What emerges from my reconstruction is an original justificatory argument for the value of liberal education as general education in the sense of initiation into the heritage of the humanities. To close, I evaluate the scope and power of this argument from the existential concern of the humanities. "

Theorists have not given patterns the attention they deserve. Therefore it is far from clear what patterns are and to what purpose scholars may use them. This paper presents eight propositions on patterns which hold true for patterns found ‘by hand’ and patterns found ‘by computation’. One such is that a pattern is discernible in behaviour when we subject it to the intentional stance, as the philosopher Daniel Dennett argues. Here behaviour is part of an intentional system. This paper’s argument is that the patterns found ‘by computation’ too are part of an intentional system. To substantiate this claim this paper discusses two important examples of detecting computational patterns in the domain of the humanities. "

During this period has the prevalence of the humanities increased or decreased? An analysis of papers published in Leisure Sciences indicates that just over 3% have focused on the humanities (philosophy, history, ethics, the arts). There was an increase in humanities papers from 1985 to 1999; however, only one humanities paper has been published in the last 10 years. Implications for the next 40 years of leisure research include emphasizing the humanities in leisure studies education and encouraging special journal issues and conference themes focused on the humanities.

Building integrative approaches has long been acknowledged as a scientific challenge. Hence, new paths have to be forged, including revisiting basic ontological and epistemological considerations, such as how we understand the world, what knowledge is, and the role of science. Constructive interdisciplinary dialogues in IPBES supports the development of innovative frames and terminologies. One example is the evolution from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ecosystem service framework to the Nature’s Contributions to People classification now applied in IPBES assessments. IPBES is still in a learning phase and critical examination of what is accomplished this far is useful when refining ongoing modes of work and in long-term strategic considerations. "

It first examines some of the origins of the concept and goes on to a brief consideration of how sociology, political theory and economics have traditionally represented 'power' and 'knowledge'. Two key senses of power are identified and two difficulties are next identified: how to retain both senses of power in a satisfactory account of 'powerful knowledge; and how to provide a satisfactory account of the 'power' of knowledge in the humanities. By identifying three meanings of 'powerful knowledge', and making an argument for their interrelationship, the article aims to put the concept on a firmer footing and point to its potential implications for curriculum theory.

		"Abstract": "Issue: Medical education has \"muddy zones of practice,\" areas of complexity and uncertainty that frustrate the achievement of our intended educational outcomes. Slowing down to consider context and reflect on practice are now seen as essential to medical education as we are called upon to examine carefully what we are doing to care for learners and improve their performance, professionalism, and well-being. Philosophy can be seen as the fundamental approach to pausing at times of complexity and uncertainty to ask basic questions about seemingly obvious practices so that we can see (and do) things in new ways. Evidence: Philosophy and medical education have long been related; many of our basic concepts can be traced to philosophical ideas. Philosophy is a problem-creation approach, and its method is analysis; it is a constant process of shifting frames and turning into objects of analysis the lenses through which we see the world. However, philosophy is not about constant questioning for the sake of questioning. Progression in medical education practice involves recognizing when to switch from a philosophical to a practical perspective, and when to switch back. Implications: In medical education, a philosophical approach empowers us to \"slow down when we should,\" thereby engaging us more directly with our subjects of study, revealing our assumptions, and helping us address vexing problems from a new angle. Doing philosophy involves thinking like a beginner, getting back to basics, and disrupting frames of reference. Being philosophical is about wonder and intense, childlike curiosity, human qualities we all share. Taking a philosophical approach to medical education need not be an unguided endeavor, but can be a dialog through which medical educators and philosophers learn together. "

It reflects on how our relationships to publishing change along our career paths. Indeed, while the focus on publications is significant during our junior years and continues after tenure, the pressure feels more intense and the possibility of publishing for promotion to full professor seems more elusive at the same time. The author confesses her own struggle in writing a second book. Transcending that hurdle--from associate to full--is, arguably, the most difficult challenge for most academics, particularly for women of colour, whose numbers remain abysmal at the rank of full professor.

		"Abstract": "The movement for open access publishing (OA) is often said to have its roots in the scientific disciplines, having been popularized by scientific publishers and formalized through a range of top‐down policy interventions. But there is an often‐neglected prehistory of OA that can be found in the early DIY publishers of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Managed entirely by working academics, these journals published research in the humanities and social sciences and stand out for their unique set of motivations and practices. This article explores this separate lineage in the history of the OA movement through a critical‐theoretical analysis of the motivations and practices of the early scholar‐led publishers. Alongside showing the involvement of the humanities and social sciences in the formation of OA, the analysis reveals the importance that these journals placed on experimental practices, critique of commercial publishing, and the desire to reach new audiences. Understood in today's context, this research is significant for adding complexity to the history of OA, which policymakers, advocates, and publishing scholars should keep in mind as OA goes mainstream.

Results showed that almost half (k = 224) of all sampled primary effect sizes could not be reproduced based on the reported information in the meta-analysis, mostly because of incomplete or missing information on how effect sizes from primary studies were selected and computed. Overall, this led to small discrepancies in the computation of mean effect sizes, confidence intervals and heterogeneity estimates in 13 out of 33 meta-analyses. We provide recommendations to improve transparency in the reporting of the entire meta-analytic process, including the use of preregistration, data and workflow sharing, and explicit coding practices.

These theses consist of three overarching themes which are psychology education, clinical and counseling psychology in practice, and the psychological profile of the neoliberal subject. With regard to psychology education, our discussion revolves on privatization of psychology degrees, commodification of higher education, quantity fetishism, studying to get rich, double-edged popularization of psychology, customerization of psychology education, clinical chauvinism, and packaged and pacified psychology. Under the title of clinical and counseling psychology in practice, factory models of psychological services, financialization of success, privatized life-long training, psychologization of the social and political, neoliberal psychology as the guardian of status quo, fake psychologists, and the claim of universality are presented and discussed. Finally, under the theme of the psychological profile of the neoliberal subject, we develop our arguments with reference to precarization of the population, inherent depression in neoliberalism, debt psychology, artificial needs and permanent dissatisfaction, marketing, persuasion and psychology. However, this article does not recommend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We recognize and appreciate critical voices within and outside of psychology.

		"Abstract": "Advances in digital technology have led to large amounts of personal data being recorded and retained by industry, constituting an invaluable asset to private organizations. The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, including the UK, fundamentally reshaped how data is handled across every sector. It enables the general public to access data collected about them by organisations, opening up the possibility of this data being used for research that benefits the public themselves; for example, to uncover lifestyle causes of poor health outcomes. A significant barrier for using this commercial data for academic research, however, is the lack of publicly acceptable research frameworks. Data donation—the act of an individual actively consenting to donate their personal data for research—could enable the use of commercial data for the benefit of society. However, it is not clear which motives, if any, would drive people to donate their personal data for this purpose. In this paper we present the results of a large-scale survey (N = 1,300) that studied intentions and reasons to donate personal data. We found that over half of individuals are willing to donate their personal data for research that could benefit the wider general public. We identified three distinct reasons to donate personal data: an opportunity to achieve self-benefit, social duty, and the need to understand the purpose of data donation. We developed a questionnaire to measure those three reasons and provided further evidence on the validity of the scales. Our results demonstrate that these reasons predict people's intentions to donate personal data over and above generic altruistic motives. We show that a social duty is the strongest predictor of the intention to donate personal data, while understanding the purpose of data donation also positively predicts the intentions to donate personal data. In contrast, self-serving motives show a negative association with intentions to donate personal data. The findings presented here examine people's reasons for data donation to help inform the ethical use of commercially collected personal data for academic research for public good. "

Participants completed measures of economic resources, work volition, career adaptability, occupational engagement, and future decent work perceptions. The results illustrated measurement invariance between the two samples. Thus, the hypothesized models were tested separately in the two samples and the results were compared regarding parameter significance, direction, and magnitude. Overall, the modified model generally fit well with both samples. However, there were notable cross-cultural differences: economic resources significantly predicted work volition, occupational engagement, and future decent work perceptions only in the United States sample and the future decent work perceptions and occupational engagement were negatively associated in the Korean sample. Explanations about the cross-cultural differences and invariances were provided and practical and research implications were discussed. Public Significance Statement: This study examined predictors of occupational engagement and future perceptions of decent work among undergraduate samples from the United States and Korea. Although psychological factors such as the perceived ability to freely make career choice and the resources to cope with various career tasks were important for both sample, notable differences existed concerning the links between economic resources to career-related behaviors and perceptions of future work.

In this article, we take a closer look at physicist and philosopher Karen Barad's work in the emerging field of new materialism as an example of postmodern theory. The aim is to analyze Barad's subject model as such and what it entails for doing the science of psychology. We will do this by analyzing Barad's notion of the subject through three different types of subject models. This analysis will then be supplemented by a critical inquiry into Barad's subject model by way of phenomenology. We conclude that Barad's subject model is unfit for studying the subject in psychology as she leaves no room for the universal characteristic of experiential life, which makes it impossible to generalize psychological findings—a necessity in science—and that this criticism could apply to other subject models like hers in postmodern theory.

This commentary can be understood as a logical progression within the author's larger intellectual journey, reflecting longstanding concerns about threats to objective truth. One take-home lesson is the perils of taking language too literally as a constitutive matrix in deploying counter concepts, as opposed to the empirical realities of how those concepts function (and get wielded) in the world. Importantly, this includes debates over who counts as \"oppressed\" and who gets to claim this status. As one alternative to Teo's unsustainable dichotomies, I offer a metaphorical \"psychology from ahead\" whose concepts and interpretive findings anticipate unfamiliar experiences and challenges evolving in real time, and where emergency and crisis serve as the lens for combating injustices, epistemic and otherwise.

The current paper focuses on disentangling two separate conceptions of the term that have added to the confusion. One meaning of the term behavior pertains to natural scientific epistemology, specifically the requirements of empirical methodology and its reliance on data that are measurable and available to public observation. The second meaning pertains to ontology and relates to the fact that at a descriptive level there are different kinds of behavioral patterns in the universe. Put simply, inanimate material objects behave differently from living organisms, which behave differently from animals, which behave differently from people. This paper introduces a \"Periodic Table of Behavior\" derived from Henriques', Review of General Psychology, 7, 150–182, (2003, 2011) Tree of Knowledge System to map the different kinds of behaviors that are described and examined by different sciences. It concludes by using the formulation to clarify the relationship between the methodological and ontological description of behavior and argues how the basic science of psychology can be effectively defined as the science of mental behavior going forward.

There is, however, great variation in the degree to which individuals help or hinder one another, or adhere to ethical standards of \"rightness.\" One way to understand this variation is by drawing on theories and models within personality psychology, which may illuminate the basic individual characteristics that drive a wide range of other‐regarding tendencies. In this review, we provide a snapshot of three research strands addressing these themes. The first concerns how personality traits map onto prosocial preferences for fairness and cooperation, as studied using classic social decision‐making tasks called economic games. The second concerns the robust associations between personality traits and indicators of inter‐group prejudice (e.g., authoritarian ideology). The third concerns the emerging concept of moral exceptionality, and the personality traits that may characterise individuals at the forefront of moral progress. These examples demonstrate the core role that personality psychology is playing in the study of prosocial and moral behaviour, as well as the critical mass emerging in the Australian context around these themes.

Despite this, some psychological perspectives ignore this research. If we wish to comprehensively understand the impact of parenting, the environment, or any social factor, however, we must engage with genetics. In this article, I review research that reveals that genes affect not only our personalities, but the way that we understand and react to the social world. Studies further reveal that notable life events are in part explained by genetic variance. I detail how this could be the case through active, evocative, and passive genetic correlations, and go on to argue that all complex psychological traits are likely the result of multifaceted gene by environment interactions. A mistaken belief that genetic influence implies genetic essentialism, and is therefore tantamount to prejudice, is raised as possible reason why heritability is often ignored in the social sciences. The article concludes with practical suggestions for how we can embrace behavioural genetics as our methods struggle to match the divine complexity of human existence. "

		"Abstract": "Emotional intelligence is a relatively recent and important concept in psychology, where the individual's ability to control his (her) emotions and to deal with the behavior of those around him (her) is taken into account. This implies a dynamic relationship between concepts such as the opposite which are rationality and emotion, where the emotionally intelligent individual would be located in the right middle of these two poles. A very recent way of representing these triadic relationships is the neutrosophical psychology theory, where if A is a psychological concept, the dynamical interaction of the concept is represented by the scheme (<A> <NeutA> <AntiA>). This paper studies the behavior of the emotional intelligence in a group of university students from the Autonomous University of Los Andes in Ecuador using classical statistical inference tools, according to the triad ( <EI> <NeutEI> <antiEI >). The main motivation of this paper is to study the state of EI in the students of this university since a high EI will guarantee better future professionals and higher quality learning. "

I argue that the production of scientific racism in the literature of psychology is unlikely to be affected by such research. Assertions by psychologists of Black people's average inferiority in brain size, intelligence, and morality have persisted for over 100 years despite repeated, careful critiques. Recent presentations of these old and discredited claims have sidestepped the fundamental criticism that they rest on essentialized racial categories. The survival of scientific racism in mainstream psychology journals should be understood as a community project with its own Weltanschauung of \"racial progress.\" "

		"Abstract": "This commentary welcomes Held's (2020) article on epistemic violence in psychological science. When psychologists employ social categories, such as \"Black people\" or \"the Japanese\" as \"fixed factors\" in their experiments, they may ignore the social construction of these categories within a cultural context. This can lead to cultural conceptions being enshrined in a methodology that has a tendency to essentialize social categories, with their inferred psychological attributes simply becoming a question of their \"accuracy\" or \"inaccuracy\" and not about the history and ideologies within which they are formed. Cultural psychology and Indigenous psychologies challenge this ideological neutrality of social categories, which is illustrated by Hinton's cultural model of stereotypes. Ignoring the evidence that traditional academic psychology is a cultural psychology (rather than an objective science) simply maintains the dominant ideological structures of epistemic violence within it.

		"Abstract": "Beset by detection of replication failures and questionable research practices over the last decade, psychology has been deemed by many to be in crisis. The situation is exceptional not only for the many investigative practices being scrutinized but also for the attention given to the undue influence of psychologists' psychology on those practices. Comparative analysis of 2 crises finds that the earlier one focused on the experimenters' activities within the laboratory, whereas the current concerns center on experimenters' postexperimental work. Whereas the previous crisis did include deep concerns about experimenters, the currently offered psychologies of fellow psychologists are distinctive in their frequency, intensity, and considerable reliance upon established knowledge about human thought and behavior. In so utilizing scientific psychology to assess psychology, the current appraisals give richer evidence of the circuitry of psychological knowledge as it travels from the laboratory outward and back. They give considerable attention to the scientists' moral characteristics, whereas the earlier crisis generated concerns about experimenters' conduct in the laboratory and the politics surrounding the application of psychological knowledge. Through their direct discussions of personal and moral conduct, the assessments also resonate with uncertainties about scientists' self-control, normative ethics, and emotions. Taken together, the psychologies and attendant uncertainties illuminate present conditions of psychology's scientific self and invite reflection on the close connections between that self, ethos, and epistemology.

This growth area within e-mental health has been well documented in Professional Psychology: Research and Practice. This article provides an update on the issues of safety and efficacy in mental health app development, two of the biggest concerns that practicing psychologists have about these new digital tools. Governments and medical authorities are wrestling with how to regulate the health app market to avoid harm to users. At the same time, a lack of research into the efficacy and effectiveness of most mental health apps in the various app stores leaves clinicians and consumers with uncertainty. The vast majority of the limited research to date has been completed by those involved in an app's development. Further independent research and replication are required to demonstrate legitimacy and increase the acceptance of mental health apps as valid sources of therapy. Complicating this issue is disparity about an acceptable methodology for examining the effectiveness of a mental health app. This article proposes a new approach to incorporate multiple baseline single-case designs to increase the amount of evidence and to guide larger-scale randomized controlled trials, something that could and should include practicing psychologists. This novel approach also proposes that mental health apps undergo a new \"certification\" process with the participation of app store marketplaces. "

This assumption has yet to be fully tested in the psychological sciences. We therefore aimed to assess the transparency and reproducibility of psychological meta-analyses. We conducted a meta-review by sampling 150 studies from Psychological Bulletin to extract information about each review's transparent and reproducible reporting practices. The results revealed that authors reported on average 55% of criteria and that transparent reporting practices increased over the three decades studied (b = 1.09, SE = 0.24, t = 4.519, p <.001). Review authors consistently reported eligibility criteria, effect-size information, and synthesis techniques. Review authors, however, on average, did not report specific search results, screening and extraction procedures, and most importantly, effect-size and moderator information from each individual study. Far fewer studies provided statistical code required for complete analytical replication.

CHD patients of this sample were selected on the basis of their similar characteristics and equal scores on measures. Then utilizing the experimental approach, CHD patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Only CHD patients in intervention group received the positive emotion therapy. Both groups provided data on measures of gratitude, optimism, happiness, and CHD symptoms before and after administering positive emotion intervention to intervention group. In this study independent and paired sample ttests, the analyses of comparison between and within the both groups were employed. Results: A sample of 127 cardiac patients were included in the study. CHD patients were 40. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=20) and control groups (n=20). Only CHD patients in intervention group received the positive emotion therapy. A significant decrease in CHD symptoms and an increase in positive emotions of patients in intervention group after receiving the positive therapy than before was found. Patients of intervention group were found with low CHD symptoms and high positive emotions after therapy than that of control group.

		"Abstract": "To infer the parameters of mechanistic models with intractable likelihoods, techniques such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are increasingly being adopted. One of the main disadvantages of ABC in practical situations, however, is that parameter inference must generally rely on summary statistics of the data. This is particularly the case for problems involving high-dimensional data, such as biological imaging experiments. However, some summary statistics contain more information about parameters of interest than others, and it is not always clear how to weight their contributions within the ABC framework. We address this problem by developing an automatic, adaptive algorithm that chooses weights for each summary statistic. Our algorithm aims to maximize the distance between the prior and the approximate posterior by automatically adapting the weights within the ABC distance function. Computationally, we use a nearest neighbour estimator of the distance between distributions. We justify the algorithm theoretically based on properties of the nearest neighbour distance estimator. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we apply it to a variety of test problems, including several stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks, and a spatial model of diffusion, and compare our results with existing algorithms.

While widely invoked in inverse-problem studies, the utility of the theorem has not been quantitatively scrutinized to any large degree. We show that Henderson's theorem has practical shortcomings for disordered and ordered phases for certain densities and temperatures. Using proposed sensitivity metrics, we identify illustrative cases in which distinctly different potential functions give very similar pair correlation functions and/or structure factors up to their corresponding correlation lengths. Our results reveal that due to a limited range and precision of pair information in either direct or reciprocal space, there is effective ambiguity of solutions to inverse problems that utilize pair information only, and more caution must be exercised when one claims the uniqueness of any resulting effective pair potential found in practice. We have also identified systems that possess virtually identical pair statistics but have distinctly different higher-order correlations. Such differences should be reflected in their individually distinct dynamics (e.g., glassy behaviors). Finally, we prove a more general version of Henderson's theorem that extends the uniqueness statement to include potentials that involve two- and higher-body interactions. "

Second, scalability is an intrinsic characteristic that is so crucial in coping with a large scale dataset. In this paper, a homogeneous ensemble feature ranking algorithm is considered, and the nine rank fusion methods used in this algorithm are analyzed comparatively. The experimental studies are performed on real six medium datasets, and the area under the feature-forward-addition curve criterion is assessed. Finally, the statistical analysis by repeated-measures analysis of variance results reveals that there is no big difference in the performance of the rank fusion methods applied in a homogeneous ensemble feature ranking; however, this difference is a statistical significance, and the B-Min method has a little better performance.

Traditional data sources, namely survey and administrative data, represent nowadays a valuable but small portion of the global data stock, much thereof being held in the private sector. The availability of new data sources is only one aspect of the global change that concerns official statistics. Other aspects, more subtle but not less important, include the changes in perceptions, expectations, behaviours and relations between the stakeholders. The environment around official statistics has changed: statistical offices are not any more data monopolists, but one prominent species among many others in a larger (and complex) ecosystem. What was established in the traditional world of legacy data sources (in terms of regulations, technologies, practices, etc.) is not guaranteed to be sufficient any more with new data sources. Trusted Smart Statistics is not about replacing existing sources and processes, but augmenting them with new ones. Such augmentation however will not be only incremental: the path towards Trusted Smart Statistics is not about tweaking some components of the legacy system but about building an entirely new system that will coexist with the legacy one. In this position paper we outline some key design principles for the new Trusted Smart Statistics system. Taken collectively they picture a system where the smart and trust aspects enable and reinforce each other. A system that is more extrovert towards external stakeholders (citizens, private companies, public authorities) with whom Statistical Offices will be sharing computation, control, code, logs and of course final statistics, without necessarily sharing the raw input data.

Separation models split diffuse and direct components of solar radiation from the global horizontal radiation. At the moment, all separation models only issue predictions that are deterministic (as opposed to probabilistic). Since the best prediction is necessarily probabilistic, a parametric post-processing framework called the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) is introduced in this paper, to make probabilistic predictions. EMOS takes the diffuse fractions predicted by an ensemble of existing 1-min separation models, and outputs a predictive distribution, with parameters optimized by maximum likelihood estimation. Clearly, the EMOS-based separation modeling goes beyond the current literature, in terms of uncertainty quantification. Eight popular separation models from the literature, with different architectures, are used to demonstrate the predictive power of EMOS. Using 1-min high-quality radiometric data from seven stations in the USA and four stations in Europe, it is found that Y ang2 is the best stand-alone model with an average RMSE of 21.8%, in terms of direct normal irradiance prediction, contrasting the 26.3% of the previously reported best model, namely, E ngerer2. On the other hand, the EMOS post-processed predictions have an average RMSE of 20.8%, which is lower than that of the best stand-alone model. Moreover, EMOS is shown superior to simple model averaging, in terms of continuous ranked probability score and ignorance score. "

		"Abstract": "Background: The efficient and robust statistical analysis of the shape of plant organs of different cultivars is an important investigation issue in plant breeding and enables a robust cultivar description within the breeding progress. Laserscanning is a highly accurate and high resolution technique to acquire the 3D shape of plant surfaces. The computation of a shape based principal component analysis (PCA) built on concepts from continuum mechanics has proven to be an effective tool for a qualitative and quantitative shape examination. Results: The shape based PCA was used for a statistical analysis of 140 sugar beet roots of different cultivars. The calculation of the mean sugar beet root shape and the description of the main variations was possible. Furthermore, unknown and individual tap roots could be attributed to their cultivar by means of a robust classification tool based on the PCA results. Conclusion: The method demonstrates that it is possible to identify principal modes of root shape variations automatically and to quantify associated variances out of laserscanned 3D sugar beet tap root models. The introduced approach is not limited to the 3D shape description by laser scanning. A transfer to 3D MRI or radar data is also conceivable. "

		"Abstract": "We present the software platform 2CALM that allows for a comparative analysis of 3D localisation microscopy data representing protein distributions in two biological samples. The in-depth statistical analysis reveals differences between samples at the nanoscopic level using parameters such as cluster-density and -curvature. An automatic classification system combines multiplex and multi-level statistical approaches into one comprehensive parameter for similarity testing of the compared samples. We demonstrated the biological importance of 2CALM, comparing the protein distributions of CD41 and CD62p on activated platelets in a 3D artificial clot. Additionally, using 2CALM, we quantified the impact of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β on platelet activation in clots. The platform is applicable to any other cell type and biological system and can provide new insights into biological and medical applications. Author summary: Single-molecule localisation microscopy (LM) became more accessible over the past years. Companies and research facilities developed instruments for 3D/2D LM, but there is a lack of comparison methods for LM-images. Our tool offers a new comparative analysis of LM data. Our system is capable of showing the difference on the level of single molecule clusters and provides information on differences between images on various scales. We determine if clusters formed of molecule localisations are comparable. We display the difference on density or the shape of these formed clusters for a certain dimension. Since the comparison is performed for all dimensions, the differences between cluster properties are observed very precisely. Thereby, we learn if clusters of molecules are formed and how they differ in both samples. For a fast/concluding comparison, we have added tools, which derives a percentage of equality of both images based on all comparison results. The tool is useful for comparison of images of molecules in cells, which are expected to differ from each other (exemplified with platelets). The differences might be caused by drug treatment, different disease progress or other environmental/genetical issues. The analysis is performed at a single cell level as well as cell cluster level.

Much of the accumulated experience derives from teaching in the \"Methods and tools for official statistics\" and \"Survey methods: traditional and new techniques in Official Statistics\" courses in the European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS) at the universities of Florence and Pisa, as well as on numerous occasions at tertiary education centres. Such experiences highlighted the lack of the themes in question within the standard study plans and the scarce awareness of students about the official statistics; and allowed the identification of the essential topics to be addressed. Four basic pillars (definitions, quality criteria and practices, sources, and autonomy in finding official data) need to be spread much more than only by statistical authorities. Manuals on basic statistics (data-science) should always foresee one or more chapters dedicated to the recognition of quality data and official statistics. Teachers from any discipline which implies the transmission of the value of high quality statistical information need to be trained on this aspect. The general insight of the experience of teaching official statistics is that if data science may remain a specialist knowledge, statistical literacy needs to become a common one. "

However, this idea can not be used in practice as is because Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. In this paper we develop an algorithmic version of algorithmic statistics that uses space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. We prove a space-bounded version of a basic result from \"classical\" algorithmic statistics, the connection between optimality and randomness deficiences. The main tool is the Nisan–Wigderson pseudo-random generator. An extended abstract of this paper was presented at the 12th International Computer Science Symposium in Russia (Milovanov 10). "

For |q| ≠ 1 the leading terms of the second cumulant reproduce the N3/2 scaling expected for models in the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. The scaling corresponds to the crossover between the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang and Edwards–Wilkinson universality classes.

This ElGamal map x ↦ g x is poorly understood, and one may wonder whether it has some randomness properties. This work presents two pieces of evidence for randomness. Firstly, experiments with small primes suggest that the map behaves like a uniformly random permutation with respect to two properties that we consider. Secondly, the theory of Sidon sets shows that the graph of this map is equidistributed in a suitable sense. It remains an open question to prove more randomness properties, for example, that the ElGamal map is pseudorandom. "

		"Abstract": "Science is widely regarded as being necessary for effective international environmental decision-making and risk assessment processes. However, it is equally well recognized that uncertainties or the complexity of phenomena under study mean that science may only offer partial knowledge for environmental problems in many circumstances. 'Democratization' of science is often proposed as a solution to this dilemma. This may involve incorporating a wider spectrum of expert views and public inputs in risk assessments of new technologies, public participation in science through so-called 'citizen science' initiatives or the application of the precautionary principle. This reply reviews these approaches and contrasts them with another tantalizing possibility offered by Anna-Maria Hubert's article; a human rights-based approach drawing on the 'oft-neglected' right to science. It assesses the extent to which a rights-based approach, utilizing the right to science, offers a way to bridge the gap between science and democracy in contested international environmental legal decision-making processes. While it concludes that there are important potential benefits to the application of the right to science in international environmental law, it is far from clear that it provides a panacea given the limitations on the right expressed in the international human rights instruments in which it is found, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Instead, the right to science can be seen as placing another thumb on the scales – alongside the precautionary and participatory approaches – in favour of enabling broader, more democratically accountable decision-making in cases of uncertain science and contested environmental risks.

This process is accompanied by changes in the normative structure of science. Poland provides an interesting case for empirical study of the scientific ethos mostly because in a relatively short time it experienced a significant reform of the science system, especially in terms of evaluating and financing scientific work. In this paper we examine whether different sets of values and norms are embedded into the normative structure of science in contemporary Poland. The results of a representative survey conducted among 801 researchers were examined with the use of confirmatory factor analysis and fuzzy clustering. The statistical analysis revealed a great complexity in the normative structure of science that goes beyond the expectations formulated on the basis of the theories reviewed. We identified three distinctive groups of researchers, guided by different sets of values and norms in their professional conduct (academic science, post-academic science and the industrial science) and a cluster of researchers with an unidentified system of principles. We argue that the complexity of the normative structure of science should be taken into account in the decision-making regarding any future reforms of the science system. "

Like the situation when the shaping of science was preceded by the emergence of methodology, a similar process had been taking place in this domain: First, methodological studies aimed at the forming of design thought made their appearance and then—on their basis—design as an independent sphere of activity and practice began to take shape. The article analyzes the methodological principles of design (the principles of correspondence, of economy, of optimum, etc.) formulated by Alexander Vladimirovich Rosenberg, demonstrating that, in his suggestions, he was drawing not only on his vision of the design experience available at the time but also on the ideas of Alexander Bogdanov's Tectology—primarily the organizational and systemic ones. The author reveals certain particulars of the shaping of design: the role of prerequisites of its emergence, the significance of methodological research, the impact of Bogdanov's Tectology.

Thus, we face a hard question: The Question of Balance How should Balanced Reporting and Reliable Reporting be balanced in science reporting? The present paper contributes substantive proposals in a manner that integrates philosophy of science with the recent empirical literature on science communication. Specifically, I articulate and evaluate strategies for balancing Balanced Reporting and Reliable Reporting. First, I provide a diagnosis of the conflict between them that is informed by philosophy of science. On this basis, I provide restrictions of both Balanced Reporting and Reliable Reporting. The restrictions are unified because they are inspired by similar reflections about the epistemic basis of science reporting—namely scientific justification. Moreover, I note some empirical work that supports the restrictions as well as some empirical work that indicates some limitations of them. Thus, the paper exemplifies how an empirically informed philosophy of science may bear on a question of societal concern. "

Although humor is frequently regarded as peripheral to the work of science, the journal provides an opportunity to understand how it contributes to the social infrastructure of scientific communities as modern workplaces. Taking methodological cues from cultural history, ethnography, and humor studies, this essay conducts a close and contextual reading of Brighter Biochemistry. This reading demonstrates how humor served as a central means through which members of the Dunn confronted workplace issues, including creating cooperative work teams, responding to gender discrimination, addressing funding anxiety, and defining professional identity. These conclusions provide a new perspective on the well-documented history of the Dunn and also offer a model for how historians of science can approach humor when its traces are encountered in other settings.

		"Abstract": "During forensic interviews, eyewitnesses are to retrieve correct information from memory. Cognitive load should be high, leading to risks of giving in to suggestive questions and difficulties in memory retrieval generally. Testifying in a non‐native vs. native language may require even more cognitive effort due to the need to inhibit the interference of the native language. Such witnesses may also be more motivated to appear credible because they often belong to ethnic outgroups relative to forensic professionals, risking more scepticism. In this study, Swedish participants (N = 51) reported their memory of a simulated crime event either in English (non‐native language) or in Swedish (native language) and were tested for suggestibility and accuracy. Results showed that English‐speaking witnesses yielded to more suggestive questions, perceived themselves as less credible but were equally accurate. Results suggest that testifying in a non‐native language is taxing cognitive resources, in turn increasing suggestibility and suboptimal memory search. "

		"Abstract": "The use of English language by Dalit writers is political as it incorporates debates surrounding their oppression and marginalization. Literature and speech have become the Dalit means of rebellion while at the same time represents the power that must be regained from the strangles of the Hindu-Brahmin society. Dalits were denied learning Sanskrit, the 'language of the Gods' as it was reserved for the privileged upper caste males. Hindu scriptures which were interpreted and authorized by the Brahmins reinforced Dalit subordination. Dr. B.R Ambedkar therefore believed that right to knowledge is the first step towards emancipation. Dalit writing emerged from this very principle and has created a medium of expression in its own unique way. Postcolonial writers like Sharankumar Limbale and G.N Devy talk about several issues pertaining to Dalit language and writing in many of their texts. Limbale in particular feels that Dalit writingrelies a lot on the use of colloquial terms and does not follow the strict rules of grammar. Their language is impolite and uncouth and it makes use of images and symbols that are appropriate to convey the Dalit experience. The use of their mother tongue grants the writers the sharpness of expression. Therefore, many Dalit writers prefer to write in their own mother tongue. But there are also other Dalit writers who view English as a language of Dalit emancipation and liberation. In the course of this paper I have incorporated works of Meena Kandasamy, who is often considered to be the first woman Dalit poet in English, and her poems which focus on the power of language and subvert many of the prevailing ideologies within patriarchy as well as feminist criticism.

		"Abstract": "Up to date, there is scarce quantitative literature accounting for the interrelationships of the components (policies, beliefs, and practices) of academic language policy. This paper reports findings from a mixed-methods study of the enactment of academic English language policy by focusing on international students' perceptions of the classroom language policy (English-only) in three Canadian EAP programmes. With corroborative findings, this study identifies general trends in students' perceptions and beliefs towards the implementation of classroom language policy as well as factors that contribute to students' ambivalence and varied perspectives. Major findings reveal the tensions and conflicts between top-down language requirements/expectations and the actual language use/choice in the EAP classroom. Discussions of the findings suggest that, despite the increasing awareness of the homogenising effects of internationalisation as embodied in the monolingual orientation in classroom language policy, the linguistic and cultural differences which mark the Chinese students' identities and holistic linguistic repertoires seem to remain othered and their language needs marginalised by the hosting communities. This empirical study may deepen current understandings of the interrelationships between language choice and language beliefs and provide implications for language policy making in alignment with internationalisation of higher education.

It was assumed that parents', teachers', and peers' support influenced the reading amount via reading goal orientation. Gender and age were taken into consideration when calculating the mediating effect. Moreover, the cross-group invariance of gender was explored. Structural equation modelling was used to examine the relationships among the examined variables. The results of the structural equation modelling and mediation analysis showed that parents' and teachers' support predicted the reading amount positively and significantly, and that the effect of parents' and teachers' support on the reading amount was mediated by goal orientation, and there was no gender difference in terms of the mediating role of goal orientation. The implications include discussions on how parents and teachers can support reading and on how to enhance goal orientation and the reading amount. "

		"Abstract": "Spelling is a key transcription skill for writing. While little is understood about the particular challenges some students experience when learning to spell, explicit instruction is known to improve spelling performance. The study reported in this article draws on eight case studies from a larger Australian mixed‐methods study examining spelling acquisition, as represented by a stratified random sample of Australian students aged 8 to 12 years (n=1,198). This case study utilised Triple Word Form Theory for the spelling error analysis of dictated words, narrative and expository writing, as well as semi‐structured interview data from a randomly selected sample of low‐achieving spellers. Analyses of phonological, orthographic and morphological spelling errors revealed students' common and unique challenges in learning to spell. Qualitative analysis of semi‐structured interview data identified that the students lacked confidence in spelling, used limited strategies for spelling unknown words, and displayed constrained metalanguage associated with spelling. Interview data from the respective classroom teachers revealed that the teachers had inadequate strategies for teaching spelling and lacked confidence in their ability to teach spelling. The findings highlight the need for improved ways to support those students beyond the first few years of schooling who find learning to spell challenging. "

The English language has faced many ups and downs in this country over the past 50 years, which makes its story even more entitled to academic investigation. The objective of this paper is to add to the existing but still limited literature of English in Iran. Having followed the model suggested by Berns (1990), this paper provides a sociolinguistic profile of English in Iran from the Qajar era (1796‐1925) through the Pahlavi dynasty (1925‐1979) and the Islamic Revolution to the present era.

This article delineates a national scenario of such journals in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) and explores their efforts and predicaments in bringing China's HSS research to the world. Based on first-hand data collected empirically through interviews and documents, it shows that HSS English-language journals in China attempt to challenge yet are conditioned at the same time by the imbalanced international knowledge structure. While still at a preliminary stage of development in terms of quantity and quality, the journals have already been confronted with major challenges including English language hurdles, unfavorable position in research evaluation systems, unfamiliarity with standards of international academic writing and publishing, and tensions between international ambition and local commitment. This article argues that HSS journals in non-Western societies including China need to strike a balance between their contemporary bid for international visibility and long-term contribution to multiple perspectives in global HSS research.

		"Abstract": "In this article, an evaluation of the English early childhood education context reveals children constructed as data. The complex, chaotic and unpredictable nature of the child is reconstituted in numerical form – a form which can be measured, compared and manipulated. Children are reconceptualised as data doppelgängers, ghostly apparitions which emulate the actual embodied child. The focus of early childhood education and care thus moves from child-centred to data-centred education. The author specifically focuses on the impact of this aspect of the performative regime on children who have English as an additional language – an under-researched area in the field. Foucault's work on governmentality is used as a theoretical lens through which to understand the process of datafication. The author uses a composite child, generated from a number of children from her experience as a teacher, as a starting point for discussion. This reveals children as disadvantaged, as their home languages are no longer used to assess communication skills. Their data doppelgängers are not useful to the teacher as they are unable to demonstrate a Good Level of Development – a key measure of school readiness in English policy. The author argues that in post-Brexit-vote Britain, subtle changes to early childhood education increase disadvantage, promoting white, British culture and thus marginalising those from other cultures.

In this paper, results of an online survey measuring the acceptability of variable agreement in collective nouns and there + be existential constructions are reported. Additionally, the relationship between the latter forms and the Creole existential it+have is also considered. Speakers of Trinidadian English are found to hold conservative views towards variation in these contexts. For collective nouns, singular agreement is overwhelmingly preferred, and standard agreement in there + be constructions is also preferred, despite the trend in other Englishes towards the use of non‐standard agreement, particularly with the there's form. Interestingly, the Creole form is judged more favourably than the non‐standard there + be existential forms. "

Results indicate that these three varieties showed distinct patterns of usage. The IndE indigenous strand reveals evidence of substrate transfer in the use of perfect progressives and unbounded/undelimited habitual progressives. Some of the resulting usage patterns appear to have been carried over to the IndE settler strand. Diachronically, similar developmental trends can be observed in IndE and BrE, although IndE was slower to adopt these trends ('colonial lag'). By contrast, linguistic features caused by substrate transfer decreased in frequency over time. Overall, diachronic developments do not indicate divergence between IndE and BrE, supporting the analysis of Indian English being in a 'steady state' instead of advancing to full endonormativity. "

Based on the Historical Corpus English in Ghana (1966–1975) and the Ghanaian component of the International Corpus of English (mainly 2000s), representing the early and late stages of structural nativisation in the dynamic model, NP complexity is measured using five criteria (NP pattern, complexity of the premodifier, length of the pre‐ and postmodifier and complexity of the postmodifier). The study uses conditional inference trees, taking into account three potential factors: corpus, text type and syntactic function. The results show that over time the complexity of the NP in Ghanaian English has increased, which is interpreted as Ghanaians becoming more proficient and therefore employing more sophisticated structures. Text type is an important predictor; syntactic function plays only a minor role. By adding a diachronic perspective, the study contributes to current models of the evolution of world Englishes. "

Analysis was conducted to uncover whether changes occurred at different testing durations (short vs. long) and whether the observed changes varied across repeater's initial proficiency groups (low, mid, high). The writing scores measured by CELPIP bands showed great stability over the 6-month period, but the trends of development differed by proficiency group. Low proficiency test takers were more likely to have faster observable score gains, compared to the medium proficiency group, whereas high proficiency repeaters may not maintain their score levels at later attempts. Writing quality was analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) tools. Results suggested that for all proficiency groups, lexical features were more likely to improve over the 6-month period, with some measures showing improvement at 1 month; features in cohesion and syntactic sophistication, however, did not change significantly.

For the majority, (67%), English was a first language (L1), for 16% French was an L1. N = 332 children in 36 classrooms were assessed on reading and listening comprehension measures and observed in the fall and winter semesters in English and French. Results showed that, overall, ratings of AIMS sub-scales did not differ markedly across English and French classrooms. Classroom teaching quality ratings were not, however, correlated across English and French classes. AIMS ratings in either language for Atmosphere were reliable and relatively stable between fall and winter, as was Management in English. AIMS ratings predicted growth in classroom-level variance in reading and listening for English and French both concurrently and longitudinally. These results suggest that there are broad, stable commonalities in effective teaching in English and French classrooms that can be validly and reliably observed. Practically, such observations of (majority) second language teaching quality can facilitate assessment of student needs and mentoring and development needs of teachers. "

Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, it examines not only how the two groups of teachers assess students' writing holistically, but also how the two groups differ in their analytical reasons for their ratings. The results showed that in holistic evaluation, the NES and NNES teachers differed significantly, with the former assigning higher scores to all the essays. In terms of the analytic evaluation of the ten specifically categorised features, the two groups showed statistically significant differences in four categories. The NES teachers were more lenient in evaluating the categories of 'grammar' and 'sentence structure', but the NNES teachers were less severe in rating the categories of 'ideas' and 'arguments'. An analysis of the findings reveals that the differences in the assessment of students' English writing between the two groups of teachers may originate from their language learning experiences, language teaching methods and language teaching beliefs.

		"Abstract": "This article is based on the premise that mandated reading in literature classrooms may be perceived as an imposition and disliked by students. Attempts to address that scenario have suggested that text selection should be given more consideration to promote reading engagement, particularly by choosing texts which are familiar to the lifeworlds of students. Aside from ideas of familiarity and student preferences in reading, this article argues that text selection could also take into account text potentialities, as proposed by Louise Rosenblatt, from which three aspects are discernible; potentiality for participation, potentiality for a sustained reading experience, and potentiality for an enjoyable reading experience. These aspects of potentiality are illustrated and discussed through the literature classroom experiences of two Malaysian pre‐university English literature students. This article contends that ideas of text potentiality help us interpret students' responses to mandated texts and informs discussion among curriculum constructors and teachers about text selection in the literature classroom.

		"Abstract": "The area of East Anglia in which its traditional dialects are spoken has shrunk significantly over the past few decades and seen a marked decline in the use of traditional features. These include lack of -s marking on third-person singular forms (Kingston, 2000; Potter, 2018), as well as the long-standing distinction between those words descended from Middle English /ɔ:/ and /ɔu/, as in 'moan' vs 'mown', which failed to become homophonous as part of the Long Mid Mergers (Wells, 1982a). Like other relics, this distinction now only remains in East Anglia's more northern locales (Trudgill & Foxcroft, 1978; Trudgill, 2004; Butcher, 2019). This apparent 'dialect death' situation (Trudgill, 1986: 68) is the outcome of continued supralocalisation, a situation in which locally specific linguistic forms lose out to linguistic variants with greater socio-spatial currency, usually as a result of mobility and dialect contact (Britain, 2010). In East Anglia's case, Trudgill (2001) argues that dialect levelling has largely been driven by the impact of London and Home Counties varieties of English. This process is predicted to continue (Trudgill, 1986; Kingston, 2000), though is unlikely to be straightforward. Britain (2011) reports that substantial intra-regional differences are found in relation to route and rate of sound change in East Anglia. This calls for more comprehensive analyses of East Anglian English to better understand the workings of this 'heterogenous homogenisation' (Britain, 2011: 57), and how individual case studies relate to the overall shrinkage of the area in which traditional East Anglian dialects are spoken. This paper presents data in this vein from two studies undertaken in Suffolk, southern East Anglia. The first presents data on unstressed vowel tensing, which refers to the alternation between [ə] and [ɪ] in those unstressed syllables where /ɪ/ occurs in other varieties of Southern British English (SBE) e.g. 'carpet' [kɑ:pɪt] / [ka:pəʔ]. The second reports data on yod dropping, i.e. the absence of /j/ from sequences of C+/ju/ e.g. 'huge' [hju:dʒ] / [hu:dʒ]. Both variables are well known from descriptions of East Anglian dialects but, as we will see later, they appear to behave differently in this study of contemporary East Anglian English. "

Importantly, participants asked for clarification and expressed scepticism about the information presented, indicating critical engagement with the material. Through collaboration with Spanish-speaking scientists engaged in the development of GE methods of vector control, we translated highly technical scientific information into Spanish that successfully engaged Spanish-speaking participants in conversations about this topic.

This article begins by reviewing that discussion, showing how different approaches – textual, contextual and active (or performance) – connect with the language of the plays. No study, it is pointed out, has conducted an empirical investigation as to what exactly students find problematic when they read the language of Shakespeare's plays, an obvious first step, one might think, in designing an approach. The main aim of this article was to describe a study designed to do exactly this. It was conducted with two groups of Shakespeare students, one with English as a first language and one with English as an additional language. Participants were asked to identify difficulties in extracts from plays, rate specific linguistic forms according to difficulty and discuss what they think of Shakespeare's language. Common areas of difficulty included archaic words, borrowings from other languages, coinages and false friends. With these findings in mind, the article briefly reflects on pedagogical solutions that are corpus-related, arguing that these address some of the problems associated with traditional textual approaches by requiring the active involvement of learners, treating language in a contextualised fashion and focussing on the language itself.

It has got potential applications in marketing, forensic analysis, fake profile detection, etc. In recent years, the usage of bi-lingual text has raised due to the global reach of social media tools as people prefer to use language that expresses their true feelings during online conversations and assessments. It has likewise impacted the use of bi-lingual (English and Roman-Urdu) text in the sub-continent (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh) over social media. To develop and evaluate methods for bi-lingual author profiling, benchmark corpora are needed. The majority of previous efforts have focused on developing mono-lingual author profiling corpora for English and other languages. To fulfill this gap, this study aims to explore the problem of author profiling on bi-lingual data and presents a benchmark corpus of bi-lingual (English and Roman-Urdu) tweets. Our proposed corpus contains 339 author profiles and each profile is annotated with six different traits including age, gender, education level, province, language, and political party. As a secondary contribution, a range of deep learning methods, CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU, are applied and compared on the three different bi-lingual corpora for age and gender identification, including our proposed corpus.

RP is not supposed to be solitary but rather collaborative between teaching colleagues or supervisors and teachers. Thus, research on teacher development advocates a dialogic approach for mentoring novice teachers in which the participants mutually construct knowledge. The culture of the feedback event, though, can interfere with the participants' intentions for collaborative discussion given the status of the supervisor. In an 18- month ethnographic research project on three first-year teachers, I attempted to engage in dialogic RP with them to identify issues they were experiencing and discuss how to resolve them. In ethnographic research, the researcher is part of the field being studied. Through field notes and interview transcripts, I constructed three critical incidents, or episodes, in which dialogic RP was not attained. Through my recounting of critical incidents with these teachers, I argue that collective understanding of issues and use of the teacher's expertise are important, and that pushing for quick solutions is ill advised. The study shows the subjective side of conducting dialogic RP in a school setting in which participants have different backgrounds and educational perspectives. "

Following a reconstruction of the term's morphology and the transmutations it underwent during its gradual incorporation into the English language, the article identifies an undertheorized concept of society as the root cause behind the difficulties into which Alexander maneuvers himself. It concludes with a brief sketch of an alternative that can contribute to overcoming these difficulties. "

Eighty-nine typically developing children and 35 children with a DLD participated in this study. The researchers collected, transcribed, and analysed language samples from these children. MLU and MLU5 were analysed and compared between the groups. The results showed that MLU and MLU5 were significantly higher for 6-year-olds than 5-year-olds. Also, both MLU measures were significantly lower for children with DLD than for typically developing children. The findings demonstrate that MLU and MLU5 can be used to evaluate language ability and to identify children with DLD among Mandarin-speaking children aged 5 and 6 years. "

Thirty-two students finished four sets of graded readers organized by the same author with the same genre and same title, or random texts. After finishing each set of three graded readers, the students answered an eight-item questionnaire and wrote their reading feedback. Linear mixed effect models were used to analyse the data gathered from the questionnaire, taking the participants as the random effect variable, and four forms of text organization, reading time order, language proficiency, and the reading text sequence as fixed effect variables. The two 10-week treatments revealed that text organization and language proficiency have significant effects on the students' perceptions, while reading time order and text sequences do not. Students' written feedback indicated that all texts were interesting except the texts of the same titles which were boring for having to be read three times. Students' written feedback provided valuable information for selecting reading texts. Implications of the study are discussed. "

		"Abstract": "Using Australian census data, the paper examines the incidence of poor English competency in Australia from 1981 onwards. The paper examines English competency in relation to various characteristics such as sex, age, language spoken, visa type, citizenship, duration of residence and location. It finds that there was a sharp rise in the numbers of people not speaking English well between the 2011 and 2016 Censuses and special attention is given to this rise in the paper. Recently, the Australian Government unsuccessfully legislated for the introduction of a requirement of English competency at the level of IELTS 6 (the commonly used university entrance level) as a condition for the award of Australian citizenship. The paper argues that this test would have led to a very large number of disenfranchised Australian permanent residents and this would be a highly undesirable result. Nevertheless, employment and social participation are strongly influenced by English competency and residents with poor English are disadvantaged. The policy suggestion is made that participation in a course of English language training for those without functional English skills could be made a precondition of the award of permanent residence—without the application of a passing grade.

		"Abstract": "When a student struggles with a mathematics task, adults may rephrase or expand initial task instructions to clarify instructions or scaffold problem solving. Yet expanded instructions may not benefit all children, especially children with a mathematics learning disability (MLD). Here, we explore whether expanded instructions differentially affect fractions comparison performance for children with or without MLD. Fifth graders (N = 190) completed two consecutive sets of 24 fraction comparison items, each accompanied by initial or expanded instructions, respectively; and also completed vocabulary, spatial reasoning, verbal working memory, executive function, and number knowledge tasks. Results showed that fraction comparison performance was generally worse following expanded rather than initial instructions, particularly for difficult items or for children with MLD. Fixed ordered regressions showed that the strength of cognitive skills as predictors of performance varied depending on instructions format and MLD status, that the five cognitive predictors collectively accounted for more performance variation with initial compared to expanded instructions, and that vocabulary's relative predictive strength as a single predictor increased when instructions were expanded, but only for children with mathematics difficulties. These findings support the notion that problem features differentially affect children with or without MLD and that not all children benefit from hearing expanded instructions for difficult mathematics tasks.

Lack of success in mathematics and English can (a) lead to a student changing his or her major, (b) delay the student's progress toward graduation, and (c) decrease the likelihood that the student will be retained at the college the next year. Due to the importance of student success in the first college mathematics course, many colleges and universities have turned to mathematics placement systems to help ensure that students in STEM majors are likely to succeed in their first mathematics course. The results of these placement systems, however, are largely unknown. This study analyzed the results of a mathematics placement system using five years of data, which were obtained from 10,484 students enrolled in six mathematics courses. The placement system places students in level 1, 2, 3, and 4 courses based on nationally normed standardized tests in mathematics as well as high school GPAs. The success rates (grade A, B, or C) for students placed in levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 59.06%, 88.57%, 86.13%, and 88.28% respectively.

		"Abstract": "Evidence from multiple studies conducted in the past few decades converges on the conclusion that numerical properties can be associated with specific directions in space. Such spatial–numerical associations (SNAs), as a signature of elementary number processing, seem to be a likely correlate of math skills. Nevertheless, almost three decades of research on the spatial–numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect, the hallmark of SNAs, has not provided conclusive results on whether there is a relation with math skills. Here, going beyond reviewing the existing literature on the topic, we try to answer a more fundamental question about why the SNARC effect should (and should not) be related to math skills. We propose a multiroute model framework for a SNARC–math skills relationship. We conclude that the relationship is not straightforward and that several other factors should be considered, which under certain circumstances or in certain groups can cause effects of opposite directions. The model can account for conflicting results, and thus may be helpful for deriving predictions in future studies. "

		"Abstract": "Early spatial skills predict the development of later spatial and mathematical skills. Yet, it is unclear how comprehension of the words that capture spatial relations, words like behind and under, might be associated with children's early spatial and mathematics skills. The current study addressed this question by conducting a moderated mediation model to test the potential moderating effects of group factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender, on the possible mediation of spatial language comprehension on the association between spatial skill and mathematics performance. In total, 192 3-year-olds were tested on a battery of assessments, including a novel Spatial Language Comprehension Task, a test of spatial skills (2- and 3-dimensional trials of the Test of Spatial Assembly [2D and 3D TOSA, respectively]), and a composite of 2 mathematical assessments. The results indicate that this novel Spatial Language Comprehension Task is a reliable measure useful for examining group differences and the early space–math link. Specifically, higher-SES preschoolers and females had higher spatial language comprehension compared with their lower-SES peers and males, respectively. These SES and gender disparities in spatial language comprehension are concerning, given the strong association between spatial language comprehension and mathematics skills. Additionally, spatial language comprehension mediated the association between spatial skill and mathematics performance for females only. Future work should examine the potential causal role that spatial language comprehension may have in concurrent and later spatial and mathematics skills. "

This approach does not deal with diagrams qua diagrams, and is incapable of accounting for the role diagrams play as means of discovery and understanding. Alternatively, this paper purports to show that the view that the method of mathematics is the analytic method is capable of dealing with diagrams qua diagrams, and of accounting for such role. "

These results are late ascriptions and so it is difficult to say anything certain about them on philological grounds. I will seek characteristic features of the cognitive unity of the mathematical results ascribed to Thales by comparing them with Galilean physics. This might seem at a first sight a rather unusual move. Nevertheless, I suggest viewing the process of turning geometry into an axiomatic-deductive science as a process of idealization in mathematics that is parallel to the process of idealization in physics. In Kvasz (Acta Phys Slovaca 62:519–614, 2012) I offered an epistemological reconstruction of the process of idealization in physics during the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. In the present paper I try to employ these epistemological insights in the process of idealization in physics and propose a reconstruction of the cognitive unity of the mathematical results ascribed to Thales, who can, on the basis of these ascriptions, be seen as one of the initiators of idealization in mathematics.

However, to date little is known about which portion of the neural system underpinning domain‐general executive skills works to support reading and math. In this study, we aimed to answer this question using fMRI via two complementary approaches. First, imaging data were acquired whilst a sample of 231 adolescents performed each of three separate tasks designed to assess reading comprehension, numerical magnitude estimation, and EP in working memory (WM), respectively. With careful task designs and conjunction analyses, we were able to isolate cross‐domain brain activity specifically related to EP, as opposed to lower‐level domain‐general processes (e.g., visual processing). Second, the meta‐analytic tool Neurosynth was used to independently identify brain regions involved reading, math, and EP. Using a combination of forward and reverse statistical inference and conjunction analyses, we again isolated brain regions specifically supporting domain‐general EP. Results from both approaches yielded overlapping activation for reading, math, and EP in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal junction, and left precentral gyrus. This pattern suggests that posterior regions of the prefrontal cortex, rather than more central regions such as mid‐DLPFC, play a leading role in supporting domain‐general EP utilized by both reading and math.

Our case is a gifted and talented mathematics classroom with twelve students. The primary source of data consists of forty-three mathematics lessons.

The findings revealed three socio-mathematical norms (reformulations of problems, generating new problems, evaluation and correction based on the sufficiency of the information) that reflect the classroom's micro-culture, which involves problem posing. In addition to these basic norms, normative understanding related to \"posing more challenging problems\" allowed for challenging mathematical situations in the classroom, which is of particular importance for gifted and talented students. We discuss the teacher's and students' roles in problem posing activities. We also explore possible reasons for not observing socio-mathematical norms regarding the assessment of posed problems on a criterion that could support students for posing more original, more complex, and more realistic problems. The study suggests practical implications for the dynamics of a classroom where students engage in problem posing activities and theoretical implications regarding the two dimensions of a norm. "

This fact was recently used to discover an unexpected relation between classical and quantum motions that goes beyond the results provided by the Ehrenfest theorem. The Newtonian dynamics was shown to be the Schrödinger dynamics of states constrained to a submanifold of the space of states, identified with the classical phase space of the system. Quantum observables are identified with vector fields on the space of states. The commutators of observables are expressed through the curvature of the space. The resulting embedding of the Newtonian and Schrödinger dynamics into a unified geometric framework is rigid in the sense that the Schrödinger dynamics is a unique extension of the Newtonian one. Under the embedding, the normal distribution of measurement results associated with a classical measurement implies the Born rule for the probability of transition of quantum states. The mathematics of the discovered relationship between the classical and the quantum is reviewed and investigated here in detail and applied to the process of measurement of spin and position observables.

To promote a responsive environment in an effort to enable students to become artists of their own mathematics experience, I consider in this paper two facets of the mathematics classroom. Content-wise I make the argument that students need to see problem-clarifying strategies in conjunction with problem-solving techniques, as the former are essential for making progress when engaging a mathematics problem where an explicit solution is not apparent. The other facet aiming to promote student agency is providing them opportunities to work with their own practical/professional concerns as students so as to become more creative and productive artists of their mathematics experience.

I use elements from Marxian theory and Lacanian psychoanalysis to explore the concomitances between mathematics and capitalism, showing how both mathematics and capital need to suture the subject in order to thrive. Biosocial research epitomises this drive towards automation and totality, and, notwithstanding de Freitas' attempts to rescue it from the logic of control, I will argue that agent-centred intentions dismiss the underlying workings of capital as a real abstraction. I do so by engaging with elements of Deleuze's philosophy, showing how the more than human frame in which de Freitas' biosocial research rests contradicts her own perception of how biosocial research can be rescued for inclusive purposes.

Farnesene is a typical sesquiterpene with applications as fragrance, flavor and precursor for the synthesis of vitamin E/K1. In this study, a series of strategies were employed to facilitate α-farnesene accumulation in Yarrowia lipolytica. Among them, the promoter optimization of OptFSLERG20 , Sc-tHMG1 and IDI resulted in more than 62 % increase in α-farnesene production. Together with the overexpression of Yl-HMGR and ERG19 , α-farnesene content was significantly improved by more than 3.5 times. The best metabolic engineered strain obtained was therefore used for a uniform design in shake flasks to determine the optimal medium compositions. Furthermore, a maximum α-farnesene production of approximately 2.57 g/L (34 mg/g DCW) was obtained in fed-batch fermentation where glycerol was supplemented as the feeding carbon source when initial glucose was depleted. This study has laid a good foundation for the development of Y. lipolytica as a promising chassis microbial cell for heterologous biosynthesis of α-farnesene and other sesquiterpenes. "

In response, researchers and curriculum developers designed and studied Virtual Engineering Internships (VEIs) to engage students in engineering and science practices outlined by the NGSS, and alleviate some of the logistical and conceptual burden for teachers unfamiliar with engineering instruction. Nevertheless, the VEIs still require striking shifts in the way teaching and learning happens in middle school science classrooms. In this exploratory study we sought to understand whether and how teachers participating in a curriculum pilot project (n = 26) interacted with the VEIs in ways that helped them carry out pedagogical shifts called for by the NGSS, and to identify curricular features that may have supported these shifts. Findings suggest that teachers leveraged and modified the VEIs to support student engagement in engineering practices and real-world problem-solving, which suggests the potential of the curriculum to catalyse deep pedagogical shifts called for by the NGSS. From this analysis, we propose a set of curriculum design features that can support teachers in implementing ambitious engineering curricula in diverse classroom contexts. "

		"Abstract": "To promote rich discourse around scientific and engineering practices, teachers may turn to engineering design-based science curricula; however, this has discursive demands which have yet to be examined in a unit focused on integration of engineering and science. To investigate these discursive demands, we expand on the definition of discourse to include the ways of knowing, doing, talking, reading, writing, and context within science and engineering—and refer to these as disciplinary Discourses. The following major research question guided this study: how are multiple Discourses enacted by both the teacher during whole class discussions and students in small groups in an engineering design-based curricular unit? In this descriptive case study, we investigated these disciplinary Discourses in a design-based unit that focused on integration of engineering into a sixth-grade genetics unit through whole-class videos and audio recordings of a target student group. Our findings suggest that while the Discourses present in whole class discussions often reflected the focus of the daily lesson, this unit creates a space for multidisciplinary Discourse to emerge between science and engineering. Also, this teacher merged everyday and more technical disciplinary Discourses to scaffold the students' understanding. Finally, we observed multidisciplinary Discourses between science and engineering emerge in our student group, suggesting that students can successfully integrate the two disciplines. This study therefore begins to investigate the disciplinary Discourses present in a design-based curricular unit and specifically multidisciplinary Discourses that may enhance students' understanding of both science and engineering.

Here, we report the huge improvement in photoresponse performances for the IGZO phototransistor devices by introducing boron nitride (BN)/black phosphorus (BP) interface engineering. By creating an appropriate band bending and an efficient photo-generated carrier transfer path between IGZO and BP, the recombination of the photo-generated carriers in the IGZO channel is significantly suppressed. As a result, the corresponding photoresponsivity at a wavelength of 447 nm can be promoted from 0.05 A W−1 to 0.3 A W−1. A corresponding maximum external quantum efficiency of 83.4% was obtained for the BN/BP decorated IGZO phototransistor. The results imply that such interface engineering via 2D materials can be used as a general route to high performance oxide-semiconductor based optoelectronic devices. "

The atom‐cavity coupling strength can be exponentially enhanced via parametrically squeezing the cavity mode, which facilitates the generation of W state. Moreover, the evolution of the system can be optimized with suppressing the populations of the intermediate states. Numerical simulations show that the scheme is fast and high‐fidelity, immune to systematic parameter deviations, robust against spontaneous emission of atoms, and decay of cavities. Therefore, this scheme may provide some useful applications in entanglement generation. "

		"Abstract": "Engineering, as a complex and multidimensional practice of technology development, has long been a source of ethical concerns. These concerns have been approached from various perspectives. There are ongoing debates in the literature of the philosophy of engineering/technology about how to organize an optimized view of the values entailed in technology development processes. However, these debates deliver little in the way of a concrete rationale or framework that could comprehensively describe different types of engineering values and their multi-aspect interrelations in real engineering practices. Approaching engineering values from a meaning-based perspective, as in this paper, can be a reliable method of tackling such a controversial problem. This paper therefore proposes that technology development be considered a systemic normative practice and attempts to provide a comprehensive view of various built-in values, their different origins and features, and a way of prioritizing them in real engineering processes. Studying two cases of the Zayandeh Rood Dam and the Abbasi Dam will lead to practical insights into how to understand norms in technology development and incorporate them into engineering practice. "

		"Abstract": "Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) is a very ambitious emerging technology with a high potential to revolutionize many medical and industrial sectors, particularly in preclinical-to-clinical translation in the pharmaceutical arena. In vivo, the function of the organ(s) is orchestrated by a complex cellular structure and physiochemical factors within the extracellular matrix and secreted by various types of cells. The trend in in vitro modeling is to simplify the complex anatomy of the human organ(s) to the minimal essential cellular structure \"micro-anatomy\" instead of recapitulating the full cellular milieu that enables studying the absorption, metabolism, as well as the mechanistic investigation of drug compounds in a \"systemic manner.\" However, in order to reflect the human physiology in vitro and hence to be able to bridge the gap between the in vivo and in vitro data, simplification should not compromise the physiological relevance. Engineering principles have long been applied to solve medical challenges, and at this stage of organ-on-a-chip technology development, the work of biomedical engineers, focusing on device engineering, is more important than ever to accelerate the technology transfer from the academic lab bench to specialized product development institutions and to the increasingly demanding market. In this paper, instead of presenting a narrative review of the literature, we systemically present a synthesis of the best available organ-on-a-chip technology from what is found, what has been achieved, and what yet needs to be done. We emphasized mainly on the requirements of a \"good in vitro model that meets the industrial need\" in terms of the structure (micro-anatomy), functions (micro-physiology), and characteristics of the device that hosts the biological model. Finally, we discuss the biological model–device integration supported by an example and the major challenges that delay the OOC technology transfer to the industry and recommended possible options to realize a functional organ-on-a-chip system.

It is clarified that bandgap (direct/indirect) has important influence on the PL properties of STEs: indirect bandgap NCs exhibit strong exciton-phonon coupling which results in non-radiative STEs, while direct bandgap NCs exhibit moderate exciton-phonon coupling, inducing bright STE PL. Furthermore, by alloying K+ and Li+ ions in Cs 2 AgInCl 6 NCs, the NCs exhibit broadband white-light emission. Charge-carrier dynamics study indicates that the efficient white-light emission originates from the further suppressed non-radiative processes of the STEs in the direct bandgap structure.

One approach involves transdisciplinary training in which students from different disciplines work together toward a shared goal. We assessed the need for such a curriculum at Dartmouth College. Methods: We surveyed medical and engineering students' educational values; learning experiences; professional goals; and interest in transdisciplinary education and innovation. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Shared values among student groups included leadership development, innovation, collaboration, and resource sharing. Medical students felt their curriculum inadequately addressed creativity and innovation relative to their engineering counterparts (p < 0.05). Medical students felt less prepared for entrepreneurial activities (p < 0.05), while engineering students indicated a need for basic medical knowledge and patient-oriented design factors. Despite strong interest, collaboration was less than 50% of indicated interest. Conclusions: Medical and engineering students share an interest in the innovation process and need a shared curriculum to facilitate collaboration. A transdisciplinary course that familiarizes students with this process has the potential to promote physicians and engineers as leaders and innovators who can effectively work across industry lines. A transdisciplinary course was piloted in Spring 2017. "

The slope landscaping is opportune because the sliding process over time intensifies and has a major negative economic and social impact and even unpredictable environmental conditions. In this way the protection and the avoidance of particularly serious damages on the agricultural land in the perimeter, as well as other social-economic objectives in the area, consisting of numerous individual households, roads, electrical networks, can be ensured. At the same time, the degradation of environmental conditions and the improvement of existing ones, which are severely affected due to the landslides produced, are avoided.

Multiscale FE modeling couples multiple dimensions of elements in a single model. In this study, the selected existing multipoint constraint equations applied in planar coupling conditions are modified and refined for out‐of‐plane coupling conditions in a single three‐dimensional FE model. Also, the optimum location for the interface points of different elements is determined to improve the model's accuracy and efficiency. The present case study, the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth, NH, is a vertical lift bridge, which includes novel gusset‐less connections. These connections have complex geometries and therefore require finer dimension elements to represent the structural behavior, while the remainder of the structure is modeled with coarser dimension elements. To achieve an accurate and efficient multiscale model of the Memorial Bridge, multiple global FE models are developed and the predicted structural responses are verified with respect to the field‐collected structural responses of the bridge.

In HE, socio‐technical thinking is fundamental as HE projects exist at the intersection of engineering and sustainable community development. However, the literature still lacks an understanding of the key features of socio‐technical thinking. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this article is to investigate the key characteristics that distinguish the socio‐technical thinking of an expert from a novice in the context of HE projects. Design/Method: We distributed the Energy Conversion Playground (ECP) design task to students starting their engineering degree (n = 26) and practitioners (n = 16). We iteratively and inductively analyzed the responses to develop a rubric characterizing the key features of expert socio‐technical thinking. We then scored participants' responses and compared them to identify differences between students and practitioners. Results: The analysis showed that expert socio‐technical thinkers can provide high‐quality considerations across three domains: technology, people, and broader context. The comparison of the participants' scores showed that both students and practitioners scored highly in the technology domain. In contrast, students scored poorly in the people and broader contexts domains, identifying only simplistic considerations in these non‐technical areas, if at all. Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into the development of socio‐technical thinking and further validates the ECP as a trustworthy measure of socio‐technical thinking.

		"Abstract": "When engineering complex systems, models are typically used to represent various systems aspects. These models are often heterogeneous in terms of modeling languages, provenance, number or scale. As a result, the information actually relevant to engineers is usually split into different kinds of interrelated models. To be useful in practice, these models need to be properly integrated to provide global views over the system. This has to be made possible even when those models are serialized or stored in different formats adapted to their respective nature and scalability needs. Model view approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue. They provide unification mechanisms to combine and query various different models in a transparent way. These views usually target specific engineering tasks such as system design, monitoring and evolution. In an industrial context, there can be many large-scale use cases where model views can be beneficial, in order to trace runtime and design-time data, for example. However, existing model view solutions are generally designed to work on top of one single modeling technology (even though model import/export capabilities are sometimes provided). Moreover, they mostly rely on in-memory constructs and low-level modeling APIs that have not been designed to scale in the context of large models stored in different kinds of data sources. This paper presents a general solution to efficiently support scalable model views over heterogeneous modeling resources possibly handled via different modeling technologies. To this intent, it describes our integration approach between a model view framework and various modeling technologies providing access to multiple types of modeling resources (e.g., in XML/XMI, CSV, databases). It also presents how queries on such model views can be executed efficiently by benefiting from the optimization of the different model technologies and underlying persistence backends. Our solution has been evaluated on a practical large-scale use case provided by the industry-driven European MegaM@Rt2 project that aims at implementing a runtime ↔ design time feedback loop. The corresponding EMF-based tooling support, modeling artifacts and reproducible benchmarks are all available online. "

Therefore, in situ surveys are often reinforced by modern remote sensing (RS) methods for collecting forestry-related data more efficiently. This study tests a stateof- the-art data collection method for practical use in the Turkish FI system for the first time. To this end, forest sampling plots were conventionally measured to collect dendrometric data from 437 trees in Artvin and Saçınka Forest Enterprises. Then, each plot was scanned using a handheld mobile laser scanning (HMLS) instrument. Finally, HMLS data were compared against ground measurements via basic FI measures. Based on statistical tests, no apparent differences were found between the two datasets at the plot level (P < 0.05). There were also robust correlations for diameter breast height at individual tree level (r > 0.97; P < 0.01). Residual analysis showed that both positive and negative errors had a homogeneous distribution, except for plot 8 where tree stems were in irregular shapes due to anthropogenic pressures. When all plots' data were aggregated, average values for the number of trees, basal area, and timber volume were estimated as 535 trees/ha-1, 49.6 m²/ha-1, and 499.7 m³/ha-1, respectively. Furthermore, secondary measures such as the number of saplings and slope were successfully retrieved using HMLS method. The highest overestimation was in timber volume with less than 10% difference at the landscape level. The differences were attributed to poor data quality of conventional measurements, as well as marginal site conditions in some plots. We concluded that the HMLS method met the accuracy standards for most FI measures, except for stand height. Thus, the Turkish FI system could benefit from this novel technology, which in turn supports the implementation of sound forest management and planning. "

		"Abstract": "In mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) network, it is necessary to reduce the cost of sensing data transformation from mobile devices to the MCS platform in the core of the network. With the widespread deployment of access point (AP), explosive data traffic of the mobile devices is offloaded from cellular base stations to Wi-Fi networks. The congestion of the 2.4 GHz band in dual-band wireless area network makes the lower quality of experience (QoE) of users. To ease the load of 2.4 GHz band, the band-steering technology has been widely used by equipment manufacturers. However, the fixed threshold configuration strategy in band steering technology makes it easy to be exploited by setting up a great number of connection requirements in a short time, which may prevent a normal connection requirement of a user, making it difficult to satisfy the dynamic resource requirements of different services. Moreover, if the threshold is configured too high, it may result in QoE imbalance in dual bands. Besides, when the band (such as 2.4 GHz) resources cannot meet the terminal requirement, the terminal cannot autonomously switch to another band (such as 5 GHz), and this may result in a very poor QoE of users. In this paper, a secure QoE-oriented wireless network optimization framework is proposed to improve the QoE of users in dual-band network. Firstly, to ensure the overall QoE of network and balancing the QoE between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, the framework dynamically adjusts the load threshold of the frequency band based on QoE information during the association of a terminal. Secondly, to meet the basic QoE requirement of each user, the framework preferentially switches the terminals with poor QoE to the idle band after users join the network. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can improve the QoE both before and after the terminal accesses the network. Additionally, it enables the better QoE balance in dual bands. "

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a case study about smart scanning with UAV Technologies. The case study was carried out at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Timisoara, which is located near the city center, adjacent to the Bega Canal. The scope of this study was to take part of the cathedral's renovation by helping pinpoint the optimimum location for placing its new illuminating system. Since the cathedral is also a hystorical monument, by law, we first needed to scan the bulding and compare the new values we have with the old ones in order to determine if some areas needed to be repaired/restored first. Once there, all scannings and surveys were made using: GPS Leica G08, DJI Phantom 4, Leica 3D ScanStation C10. To process all data gathered, we used AgiSoft FotoScan and CloudCompare. The method used was georeferencing using Ground Control Points. A total of 18 GCP were taken, all of which were placed strategically inside the area of survey of 19,1 acres for the drone to easily see them. The total flight time was 4 minutes and it flew to an altitude of 84m with an result of 130 images. Using all data points gathered we obtained our point cloud. In order to execute this project, several criteria must be taken into consideration, for exampleThe Metropolitan Cathedral of Timisoara (Figure.1) is one of the most expensive buildings in the city and one of the most famous architectural monuments in our country. The Catedral impresses by its significant dimensions, by the architectural specificity and by the enameled tiles. The additional work consists in adding illumination of the Cathedral's façade to highlight the enameled tiles which shine beautifully when light is reflected on them. Due to the growing interest in updating geodata - mainly 3D data and cadastral data as basis for GIS and mapping applications - there is a demand for a fast and efficient surveying method that combines data acquisition with additional information such as images, orthoimages, 3D-models of buildings and infrastructure, and elevation models. One possibility for such a fast and efficient capture of georeferenced data is the use of UAV systems (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). Second possibility is 3D scanning because it allows detailed analysis of a building no matter how complex the architecture, no matter what form it would have and no matter how unconventional it would be. Using the scanned data, any intervention on the building can be planned. We can perform 3D laser scanning for buildings, monuments, heritage buildings, archaeological sites, civil constructions, industrial constructions and installations, volume monitoring. For the project mentioned above we used both 3D scanning and UAV technology. "

		"Abstract": "Widespread concerns about new technologies—whether they be novels, radios, or smartphones—are repeatedly found throughout history. Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology's positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies.

		"Abstract": "In the past decade, the early Acheulean before 1 Mya has been a focus of active research. Acheulean lithic assemblages have been shown to extend back to ~1.75 Mya, and considerable advances in core reduction technologies are seen by 1.5 to 1.4 Mya. Here we report a bifacially flaked bone fragment (maximum dimension ~13 cm) of a hippopotamus femur from the ~1.4 Mya sediments of the Konso Formation in southern Ethiopia. The large number of flake scars and their distribution pattern, together with the high frequency of cone fractures, indicate anthropogenic flaking into handaxe-like form. Use-wear analyses show quasi-continuous alternate microflake scars, wear polish, edge rounding, and striae patches along an ~5-cm-long edge toward the handaxe tip. The striae run predominantly oblique to the edge, with some perpendicular, on both the cortical and inner faces. The combined evidence is consistent with the use of this bone artifact in longitudinal motions, such as in cutting and/or sawing. This bone handaxe is the oldest known extensively flaked example from the Early Pleistocene. Despite scarcity of well-shaped bone tools, its presence at Konso shows that sophisticated flaking was practiced by ~1.4 Mya, not only on a range of lithic materials, but also occasionally on bone, thus expanding the documented technological repertoire of African Early Pleistocene Homo.

Using metallurgical technologies from the Wadi Arabah (Jordan/Israel) as a case study, we demonstrate a gradual technological development (13th-10th c. BCE) followed by a human agency-triggered punctuated “leap” (late-10th c. BCE) simultaneously across the entire region (an area of ~2000 km2). Here, we present an unparalleled, diachronic archaeometallurgical dataset focusing on elemental analysis of dozens of well-dated slag samples. Based on the results, we suggest punctuated equilibrium provides an innovative theoretical model for exploring ancient technological changes in relation to larger sociopolitical conditions—in the case at hand the emergence of biblical Edom–, exemplifying its potential for more general cross-cultural applications.

Using ultrasonic assisted extraction process, the effects of ethanol concentration, solid-liquid ratio, and extraction time on scavenging rate of DPPH radical were inspected. According to the result of single-factor experiment and the orthogonal design method, a L16(4³) orthogonal table was used to study the ultrasonic extraction technology of antioxidant active components from the Daldinia concentrica. Based on the analysis on the significance of each level and their interactions, the optimum extraction conditions were as follows: extraction time was 30 min, ethanol concentration was 100% and solid-liquid ratio was 3:100 (concentration was 30 mg⋅mL-1). Under these conditions, the DPPH antioxidant activity of the extract was the highest (76.17%). The extraction process could provide theoretical and a practical reference for the development of antioxidant substances in Daldinia concentrica. "

		"Abstract": "The term magic has long been associated with both technology and art. Whether an illusion performed on stage or the search for the supernatural, magic is concerned with changing either reality itself or our perception of it. Each new technology takes on a magical role by increasing humans' power to manipulate the world around them. Similarly, magical practices are often labeled arts, and the manipulation of our perceptions by artists often creates quasi-magical experiences. Four approaches to magic in relation to digital art practice--illusionist, alchemist, necromancer and sorcerer--offer a mode of understanding the manipulation of perceptual reality by artists using digital technologies. The framework will then be applied to five such practitioners--Pascal Dombis, Anne-Sarah Le Meur, Antoine Schmitt, Dmitry Morozov and Zaven Paré--who demonstrate the quest for the unknown and the manipulation of knowledge to create a new reality.

		"Abstract": "The work and research described in this paper draws upon the idea of the post digital to create (1) art for humanization of technology and (2) art as manifestation of digital qualities in the physical world, e.g., through digital-analog convergence and through enriching our experiences with hybrid constellations of techniques, concepts and aesthetics. This work consists of two parts: practice-based research in the arts and conceptualizations arising from art and design practice. Four art projects are presented in this thesis: Metaphone, Delete By Haiku, S T R A T I C, and Panorama Time. In this practice, post-digital approach manifests through the hacking activities and disruptive techniques. These thrive on a set of constitutive concepts: machine aesthetics, digital upcycling, aleatoricism and chance, deletion, repetition, fault aesthetics and glitch aesthetics. Those post-digital aesthetic principles depend on machinic, systematic behaviors in the technologies I explore. Machine aesthetics expose operational and mechanical principles and behaviors. Digital upcycling is a repurposing design process wherein function follows form to add value to old defunct objects. I deploy chance in the design process through a \"rolling a dice\" approach. I use both deletion and insertion repetitively as design principles. In my work, I also induce technical faults and take deliberate control of machine glitches. These are all aesthetic approaches that help transform the \"cold\" appearance of information technologies and bring them closer to people, thereby humanizing technology. Some of the aesthetic principles (e.g., machine aesthetics or glitch aesthetics) might not seem \"natural\" or \"human\" but I use them to explore digital materiality analogously to how steel, iron and other materials were approached from the early phases of the industrial revolution and Modernism. As such these aesthetic principles are ways of interrogating the digital thriving off a cultural-historical point of view. "

		"Abstract": "Purpose: Owing to recent challenges of CMOS manufacturing and power consumption in silicon technologies among alternative technologies, Nanomagnetic logic (NML) is one of the most promising technologies, so it was selected for this study. NML is non-volatile with ultra-low power dissipation that operates at room temperature. This paper aims to propose novel implementation of 2% and 4% multiplexers (MUXs) in NML technology. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed multiplexers in NML technology are verified by HDL-based simulators. In addition, this study estimated area and power dissipation of the proposed design to compare and approve the promising improvements in comparison to other similar NML implementations. Findings: The results show the remarkable improvements in terms of APDP term in comparison to the recent proposed MUXs in NML technology which are reported in Table 2. The proposed implementation of the MUX in NML is designed in three-dimensional layout to improve interconnection complexity which is an integration challenge. Also, by facilitating the routing signals and total wire length needed for clock signals, the negative impact of the power dissipated in clock wires is improved. Originality/value: These findings would appeal to a broad audience, such as the readership of Microelectronics International Journal. The authors confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere nor is it currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

The PolyMUMPs technology is complemented through self-aligned post-processing steps. This procedure eliminates the requirement of aligning masks during post-processing and enables easy prototyping of microhotplates. Two designs were fabricated, including microhotplates with gold interdigitated-electrodes and temperature sensors. The final device features a suspended membrane with dimensions of 400 × 120 μm2 and can achieve a heating temperature of 300 °C while consuming 24.1 mW of power. Long-term heating tests showed that the device can withstand a continuous heating process for more than 150 h at a temperature of 400 °C. These properties make the device suitable for targeting a wide range of applications, including the heating platform of metal-oxide type gas sensors. "

The techniques were: a pre-prepared acetate overlay; a custom-designed mobile field guide; a locative media app on a smartphone; a virtual globe on a tablet PC; a head-mounted virtual reality display, and a geo-wand style mobile app. In one field exercise the first five techniques were compared through analysis of interviews and student video diaries, combined with direct observation. This identified a particular challenge of how to direct user attention correctly to relevant information in the field of view. To explore this issue in more detail, a second field exercise deployed \"Zapp\", a bespoke geo-wand-style app capable of retrieving information about distant landscape features. This was evaluated using first-person video and spatial logging of in-field interactions. This paper reflects upon the relative merits of these approaches and highlights particular challenges of using technology to mimic a human field guide in pointing out specific aspects of the landscape scene. We also explore the role of students acting as design informants and research co-participants, which can be mutually beneficial in promoting a critical appreciation of the role of technology to support learning about the landscape.

		"Abstract": "The contrasting social and economic inequalities that exist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples has been the focus of many Canadian studies. Several interlinking factors have been found to impact the socioeconomic status of Canada's Indigenous peoples, including social distance, education, gender, and occupational characteristics. Few of these studies, however, look at the gender wage gap amongst Indigenous populations, and in this paper, we identify some of the factors that drive both income and differences in income between men and women, amongst Indigenous peoples. Using data from the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS), we examine key socioeconomic factors and identify how these are linked to income. We find that education and employment industry are major indicators of socioeconomic status, as are the interactions between gender and income. We also find a persistent gender wage gap amongst Canada's Indigenous peoples, but we find that this gap can be explained by differences in the returns to education, skill levels, and industry of employment. Plusieurs études canadiennes se sont penchées sur les inégalités sociales et économiques contrastées entre les peuples autochtones et non-autochtones. Quelques facteurs interdépendants ont été trouvés pour influencer le statut socio-économique des peuples autochtones du Canada, ainsi que la distance sociale, l'éducation, le sexe et les caractéristiques professionnels. Certains de ces études n'ont cependant pas mis l'accent sur l'écart salarial entre les hommes et les femmes de la population autochtone et, dans cet article, nous avons identifié non seulement les facteurs qui déterminent le revenu, mais aussi les facteurs de différence entre les revenus des hommes et ceux des femmes dans la communauté autochtone. En nous servant des données de Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2017 (APS), nous examinons les principaux facteurs socio-économiques et identifions comment ceux-ci sont liés au revenu. Nous postulons que l'éducation et l'industrie de l'emploi sont des indicateurs majeurs du statut socio-économique, tout comme les interactions entre les hommes, les femmes et le revenu. Nous notons aussi un écart salarial persistant entre hommes et femmes de la population autochtone du Canada, mais trouvons que cet écart peut s'expliquer par des différences dans les rendements de l'éducation, des niveaux de compétence et de l'industrie de l'emploi.

The purpose of this study was to determine (a) to what extent general education teachers used evidence-based practices—specifically, opportunities to respond, positive specific feedback, and precorrections—during classroom instruction, and (b) if those practices occurred at different rates across demographic groups (i.e., race and disability risk). The results indicated that teachers used higher rates of opportunities to respond and positive specific feedback with students not at risk compared with at-risk students. We did not find main effects of race or race-by-disability risk interaction effects. These findings support the need to continue examining teachers' differing uses of evidence-based practices. "

The OIM group was provided with a pre-practice instruction in the form of expert modeling observation by an expert athlete. The DDM group received only verbal explanations of few selected static images. Thirty-six children (18 males and 18 females, mean age = 8,8) participated in the experiment. Subjects were randomly assigned to the OIM or DDM groups. Participants were instructed to perform four sport motor sequences never performed before (shoulder stand, soccer action, vortex howler throw, step action). Actions were videotaped and 2D kinematic analysis performed. A 10-point Likert questionnaire was administered to blind sport experts to assess the correctness and accuracy of each action. Results suggest that the OIM is the most effective instruction method when participants have no experience with the sport action to be performed. On the contrary, if the athlete needs to learn specific aspects of an exercise (such as grasping a tool) the best method is the DDM. In fact, detailed information on how to grab the vortex helped children in throwing it. We also found gender differences which might reflect cultural influences in specific sports (e.g. soccer). Finally, repetition of the exercise also improved the DDM group's performance. This has potential applications in sport teaching, suggesting that in the absence of a model performing the action to be imitated, the DDM can be as effective as the OIM if the observer repeats the sport action many times.

This article presents the results from a historical analysis of federal-level U.S. policy documents spanning the years 1914-2014. We performed a systematic content analysis utilizing a context justification approach to analyze 19 pieces of U.S. legislation to discern broad patterns and trends in the area of AWE policy development. The benefits of examining policy through a lens of governance and system-level trends include gaining a clearer understanding of the evolution of key policy dimensions and how they contribute to shaping current circumstances in the field. Our analyses suggest the importance of historical conditions in shaping policy characteristics. We conclude that it is essential to understand these policy characteristics in order to seek the necessary information to more strategically advocate for AWE in the 21st century, and highlight areas where further inquiry is needed.

		"Abstract": "This Article addresses a longstanding puzzle about customary international law (CIL): How can it be, at once, so central to the practice of international law—routinely invoked and applied in a broad range of settings—and the source of such persistent confusion and derision? The centrality of CIL suggests that, for the many people who use it, it is not only comprehensible but worthwhile. They presumably use it for a reason. But then, what accounts for all the muddle and disdain? The Article argues that the problem lies less in the everyday operation of CIL than in the conceptual baggage that is brought to bear on it. Most contemporary accounts of CIL reflect what can be called a “rulebook conception.” They presuppose that, in order for a given proposition to be CIL, it must apply more or less in the same way in all cases of a given type, rather than fluctuate without established criteria from one situation to the next. This rulebook conception is wrong. It does not accurately describe the range of normative material that global actors, in the ordinary course, use and treat as CIL. And because it is wrong, it systematically sows confusion and leads analysists to devalue CIL as a kind of international law. We should stop imagining that CIL operates like a rulebook and should recognize that it is an inherently contingent and variable kind of law. "

		"Abstract": "Human beings possess a sense of basic morality that is found to be similar in many cultures. It has often been termed 'Natural Law', and St Paul in his Epistles referred to even the gentiles as having 'God's Law in their hearts'. C. S. Lewis gave a broad basic justification for the existence of Natural Law, emphasising that a society that loses this will experience moral decay. The standard western presentation of the subject was given in the thirteenth century by Thomas Aquinas, and is used as the basis for our present discussion, amplified by some recent teachings of Pope John Paul II. There are two major challenges to these ideas. One concerns the objective validity of moral law of any kind. An examination of this question leads to the familiar conclusion that God's authority is required as a basis for absolute moral values and obligations. The second major challenge comes from the modern scientific picture of human beings emerging from an amoral animal kingdom - but we are moral beings. The issues that arise here are discussed with reference to evolutionary theory, palaeontology and anthropology. It is suggested that the key questions are resolved best if God acted directly in human history at some point in time, perhaps at the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition. Some implications of Natural Law in human affairs are finally examined. "

Its function in shaping a late medieval 'feudal vocabulary' and, ultimately, modern models of feudalism was highlighted by Susan Reynolds and lies at the core of her anti-feudalism paradigm. This paper questions the disjuncture between social practice and learned law that underlies the paradigm, by analysing the context and making of the Libri feudorum and of legal writings associated with it – by Pillius de Medicina, Iacobus de Ardizone and Jean Blanc. By showing how practice could shape legal tools used by learned lawyers to frame fiefs and by reassessing the influence of the Libri feudorum on practice, the paper challenges the idea that fiefs were the outcome of professional or academic law and unveils aspects of the practical nature and intellectual dimension of lawyerly writing.

Particularly, the author explores whether and under what conditions this could happen if the law of another EU Member State, which allows deprivation of forced heirship under circumstances that are not deemed sufficient pursuant to German law, is applicable to a deceased's succession. The problem of a potential violation of public policy due to the application of foreign law on forced heirship is especially significant in Germany due to the (unusual) constitutional protection that attaches to an entitlement to forced heirship and due to the large number of foreigners living in the jurisdiction. The article considers the relevant provisions of the EU Succession Regulation, German public policy doctrine, and the law on deprivation of forced heirship in selected EU Member States. "

Metrics such as simplicity and strength determine which systematization is best, but these are notoriously language relative.

This constraint is sometimes interpreted as requiring us to know which natural properties are instantiated in our world prior to scientific theorizing. I argue that this interpretation is incorrect. I provide a better interpretation and show how it undercuts an influential epistemological objection to Lewis's best systems account of laws due to Bas van Fraassen. "

		"Abstract": "Calvin formulates an ethical framework in which the idea of natural law is interwoven with divine command ethics in a way that leads to a new awareness of the unique relationship between God's authority and human autonomy with regards to morality. For Calvin, God's creational order is the ultimate source of natural law and the natural moral order perceived by natural reason still provides true sources for human morality. He does not underestimate, however, the noetic effect of sin on natural reason. In fact, Calvin takes seriously the epistemological limitation of the created but fallen natural reason with regard to understanding the true intention of creational moral order in its full scope and meaning. So, he argues that the scriptural revelation does not just complement natural morality, but it redeems it. His view thus successfully rules out extreme views of both natural law and divine command ethics that render morality either utterly autonomous or rigidly heteronomous. For Calvin, God's authority in morality and the natural moral order are reconciled because the heteronomy of revealed laws and the autonomy of natural law are reintegrated in redeemed reason. In this view, humans can acknowledge the God-commanded biblical moral law by their natural reason because the biblical moral law is a written manifestation of natural law. The regenerate can wholly acknowledge it through the renewal of their natural reason while the unregenerate can partly acknowledge it through common grace of God that preserves functionality of natural reason in fallen humanity to a certain degree.

This has implications for how the rule interacts with the choice of law rules for contracts under the Rome Convention and the Rome I Regulation. "

Authors explore this problem in accordance with provisions of the civil legislation and form practical means for application of the right deprivation mechanism based on the analysis of international legislations. In particular, possibilities of estate seizures and gradual transformation of formalised law space into doctrinal subsystem are analysed. The work investigates the possibility to use measures of both state and private influence in this field and presents prognostic components that can affect regulation variations of estate seizure of estates based on an agreed-upon procedure between states. A different procedure is proposed for joint ownership and realisation of a provision on managing land and ecological legislations as a field of civil relations. The practical aim of the work can be applied to solving disputes regarding the need for joint regulation of civil property relations in international and local civil law.

		"Abstract": "Artur Kozak (1960–2009) was one of the most original and innovative philosophers of law to emerge from the so-called 'middle generation' of Polish post-War jurisprudence. Kozak's principal achievement was to break away from the analytical paradigm of legal theory, dominant in the in Poland at the time, and engage legal theory in a fruitful dialogue with contemporary sociology and philosophy, including such currents as social constructionism or postmodernism. To name his original theoretical project, Kozak coined a new term – 'juriscentrism' (juryscentryzm), consciously evoking Richard Rorty's concept of ethnocentrism. Juriscentrist legal theory was mainly focused on providing legitimacy for the newly gained power of the legal community in a post-socialist society, but its theoretical resonance is universal. Kozak's premature death made it impossible to complete the theoretical project of juriscentrism, nonetheless he managed to elaborate its main tenets, including the concept of juristic discretional power and a juriscentrist concept of law. Kozak's legacy in contemporary Polish legal theory is particularly visible in Wrocław, where not only the post-analytical paradigm in Poland is the strongest, but also the first Polish school of critical legal theory has recently emerged.

Groundwater resources are, however, limited and fragile due to factors such as climate change, exploitation and pollution. This renders the groundwater regulatory framework essential. Yet in South Africa, groundwater governance is not strongly emphasised in the novel regulatory framework instated by the National Water Act 38 of 1998 (the NWA). Naturally, uncertainties and challenges arise as to, inter alia, the appropriate allocation and effective protection of the country's groundwater resources.

We seek to show, further, that each one of the various philosophical accounts of the concept of natural law (in both of its senses) is embedded in a metaphysical and theological context, so that different visions of God yield different accounts of the meaning of the natural law idiom in science as well as legal theory. • Different meaning of the notion of law. • Natural law in the legal sense versus laws of nature. • Problems facing the concept of law. • The influence of legal philosophy on the philosophy of science.

		"Abstract": "Analysis of UK employment and labour law is often characterised by a curious dissonance. The overarching narrative mandates that labour law is a countervailing force to the inequality of bargaining power, embedded with values and assumptions concerning the nature of employment relations and the role of labour law. And yet, labour law jurisprudence tends to treat with respect, and seeks to decipher, abstract statutory concepts and tests derived from judicial pronouncements as if they were, indeed, a 'brooding omnipresence in the sky'. This paper seeks to bridge that gap, by offering a legal realist account of the legal doctrine that governs the employment of agency workers, focusing on the 'necessity' and 'sham' tests. It assesses the legitimacy of importing legal tests from one (commercial) context to another (employment) context; questions the courts' protestations that their use is mandated by precedent; and outlines the real implications for the status and rights of agency workers in the UK.

		"Abstract": "The article presents the issue of the judicial application of the law in contemporary Civil Law jurisdictions. This topic arouses a great deal of controversy, because it is associated with granting courts a wide range of discretionary powers, including lawmaking. In the theoretical-legal literature this issue is often dealt with by juxtaposing different ideologies on the judicial application of law: bound, free or legal and rational. This division was introduced and developed by Jerzy Wróblewski, whose concept of the judicial application of law is presented and critically analyzed in the present article, with particular attention paid to the principle of the separation of powers. In recent Polish theoretical-legal literature, discussion on this issue has tended to focus less on whether the courts in our legal system possess lawmaking competence, and more on whether they should be allowed such competence. This is due to the fact that a view now prevails in the literature which holds that, in certain cases, there is a need for creative interpretation of the law, as this can remedy the poor quality of the law enacted by the legislator.

The enacted rule was the subject of much skepticism by the academic punditocracy, however. Ten years later, this Article surveys the actual results and finds that, regrettably, pessimism has proven the better prediction. Percolation of debate over the rule's many ambiguities and courts' disparate approaches have not resolved initial critiques, but only diversified their targets and fostered new bubbles of confusion, conflict, and consternation. That said, FRE 502 has indeed improved some aspects of the state of the law of privilege--and may do more as consensus matures-- but has still left jurisprudence well short of the ideals dreamt of under its framers' vision. Nonetheless, the game is worth the candle: The pursuit of a more perfect privilege vindicates the essential individual rights of Lockean society, and the ongoing quest thus reflects that of civilization itself.

The article discusses manuscript sources from the theological faculty and central government to show how the controversy concerned not just Hojer's allegedly dangerous arguments but also embodied a heated debate about the liberty to discuss such matters in print. The controversy moreover reveals the significant presence of followers of Christian Thomasius in influential positions in Denmark in the decades around 1700. These Thomasians combined natural law with a strong criticism of the authority of orthodox theologians and, arguably the earliest and most radical, arguments for a wide-ranging liberty of thought, libertas philosophandi, in early modern Denmark. This was in turn met by proponents of a more conservative natural law supporting the theological authorities. The article concludes by discussing how Hojer and the controversy surrounding him illustrate the wider significance of Thomasian natural law for the intellectual culture, for freedom of thought, and for religious and legal reform in early eighteenth-century Denmark.

There has been an increasing tendency on the part of the Scottish courts to treat these rights of relief as a branch of the law of unjustified enrichment. This analysis, according to which a cautioner's payment of the guaranteed debt enriches the principal debtor and co-cautioners unjustifiably, thereby entitling the cautioner to redress, has been subject to academic criticism, with \"enrichment\" scholars arguing that rights of relief and unjustified enrichment are distinct areas of law. Building on the work of these scholars, this article explores the precise nature of the distinction between \"enrichment\" and \"relief\", its implications for litigants faced with the choice whether to pursue a case on the basis of \"relief\" or \"enrichment\" and the extent to which these legal areas perform complementary roles.

This article examines this complex issue—which straddles competition/regulatory law, company law, agency law, and private law (in particular the illegality defence)—from a theoretical perspective, and makes two key contributions. First, it advances a refined concept of optimal deterrence, and argues that courts should not deprive the company of its well-established right to sue under company and agency law by interpreting the deterrence policy under competition law or another regulatory statute in light of this concept and recognising the limits of judicial law-making. Second, this article demonstrates for the first time how courts should analyse private law claims arising from corporate regulatory infringements under the 'range of factors' approach to the illegality defence, using competition law infringements as an illustration. Under our proposal, courts need not proceed to the stage of balancing competing and incommensurable factors to arrive at the conclusion that companies should not be precluded by the illegality defence from recovering against their delinquent insiders.

		"Abstract": "We propose a new approach to explore Benford's law. We take the uniform interpretation of Benford's law and relax the modulus to define a range of Benford-like characteristics. We then show all fat-tailed distributions approximately satisfy Benford's law. Our theory shows Benford's law is a natural property of Riemannian sums for continuous probability densities. Our simulations corroborate this connection. "

		"Abstract": "Many prominent proponents of Old and New Natural Law morally condemn sexual acts between people of the same sex because those acts are incapable of reproduction; they each offer a distinct set of supporting reasons. While some New Natural Law philosophers have begun to distance themselves from this moral condemnation, there are not many similarly ameliorative efforts within Old Natural Law. I argue for the bold conclusion that Old Natural Law philosophers can accept the basic premises of Old Natural Law without also being committed to morally condemning sexual activity between people of the same sex. I develop an argument from analogy that shows how we can draw metaphysically distinct sub‐categories based on someone's capacity to experience the unitive goods of sex. This unitive capacity constitutes the sub‐category and provides a distinct principle for evaluating how members of that sub‐category (X) act as members of that sub‐category, rather than as acting as defective members of another category (Y). Even though my argument is 'internal' to Old Natural Law, I conclude by showing how these conclusions can also address some of the objections to same‐sex sex in New Natural Law. "

		"Abstract": "Frege claims that the laws of logic are characterized by their \"generality,\" but it is hard to see how this could identify a special feature of those laws. I argue that we must understand this talk of generality in normative terms, but that what Frege says provides a normative demarcation of the logical laws only once we connect it with his thinking about truth and science. He means to be identifying the laws of logic as those that appear in every one of the scientific systems whose construction is the ultimate aim of science, and in which all truths have a place. Though an account of logic in terms of scientific systems might seem hopelessly antiquated, I argue that it is not: A basically Fregean account of the nature of logic still looks quite promising. "

		"Abstract": "Abuse of law is a fundamental paradox: It is necessary to consider legal acts as illegal acts. The distinction legal/illegal is applied to itself. The article shows that the notion of abuse in the European context is closely related to the antinomy of the Internal Market which describes itself as a borderless area with internal borders. A closer look at the case law reveals that actors can make use of the fundamental freedoms in the form of self‐contradictory arrangements (prototype: U‐Turns). Put more generally, autonomy is taken seriously and subjective rights are not covered by law when they are exercised in a tautological or paradoxical way. "
